0,33862466,High-mobility group box 2 protein is essential for the early phase of adipogenesis.,"Understanding of the mechanism of adipogenesis is essential for the control of obesity, which predisposes toward numerous health problems. High-mobility group box protein 2 (HMGB2) is a non-histone chromosomal protein that facilitates DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and repair. Here, we studied the role of HMGB2 in adipogenic differentiation. The expression of HMGB2 was measured at the mRNA and protein levels in cultured 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells and during the process of adipogenic differentiation induced bya cocktail of insulin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and dexamethasone. This increased in the early phase and decreased in the late phase of differentiation. However, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cells did not differentiate into adipocytes after the knockdown of HMGB2 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Similarly, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from Hmgb2",obesity,highmobility group box protein essential early phase adipogenesis,understanding mechanism adipogenesis essential control obesity predisposes toward numerous health problem highmobility group box protein hmgb nonhistone chromosomal protein facilitates dna replication transcription recombination repair studied role hmgb adipogenic differentiation expression hmgb measured mrna protein level cultured tl preadipocyte cell process adipogenic differentiation induced bya cocktail insulin isobutylmethylxanthine dexamethasone increased early phase decreased late phase differentiation however tl preadipocyte cell differentiate adipocytes knockdown hmgb expression small interfering rna sirna similarly mesenchymal stem cell msc isolated hmgb

However, the role of Olfr78 in gut hormone secretion remains unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of action of Olfr78 in vivo and in vitro. Toward this, we assessed the expression of Olfr78 in several tissues, affinity of Olfr78 to various monocarboxylates, and the secretion of anorexigenic gut hormone peptide YY (PYY) via Olfr78 using various molecular and biochemical techniques. Olfr78 was abundantly expressed in the colon and mouse enteroendocrine cell line STC-1 and showed specific affinity to SCFAs such as acetate and propionate, but not butyrate, in a monocarboxylate ligand screening assay using a heterologous expression system. Acetate promoted PYY secretion in STC-1 cells via Olfr78-protein kinase A signaling, whereas the effects were abolished by Olfr78 RNA interference. Colonic SCFAs production via oral administration of fructo-oligosaccharide significantly increased plasma PYY levels, whereas this effect was abolished in Olfr78-deficient and germ-free mice. These results suggested that the SCFA receptor Olfr78 is important for anti-obesity and anorexigenic effects of the gut microbiota and dietary fibers.",obesity,gut microbial shortchain fatty acidsmediated olfactory receptor stimulation promotes anorexigenic gut hormone peptide yy secretion mouse,olfactory receptor olfr also known receptor shortchain fatty acid scfas produced via gut microbial fermentation indigestible polysaccharide dietary fiber expressed enteroendocrine cell colon however role olfr gut hormone secretion remains unknown aimed investigate function mechanism action olfr vivo vitro toward assessed expression olfr several tissue affinity olfr various monocarboxylates secretion anorexigenic gut hormone peptide yy pyy via olfr using various molecular biochemical technique olfr abundantly expressed colon mouse enteroendocrine cell line stc showed specific affinity scfas acetate propionate butyrate monocarboxylate ligand screening assay using heterologous expression system acetate promoted pyy secretion stc cell via olfrprotein kinase signaling whereas effect abolished olfr rna interference colonic scfas production via oral administration fructooligosaccharide significantly increased plasma pyy level whereas effect abolished olfrdeficient germfree mouse result suggested scfa receptor olfr important antiobesity anorexigenic effect gut microbiota dietary fiber
2,33862414,Kidney cancer mortality disparities among Hispanics in the US.,"Kidney cancer incidence is increasing among Hispanics but rate differences by distinct group, such as Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Mexican have not been studied. To fill this knowledge gap, we use mortality data, reflecting fatal kidney cancers, to examine patterns by race-ethnicity, including detailed Hispanic groups, and correlate the mortality rates with each group's prevalence of known kidney cancer risk factors: smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.
We used individual-level death data for California, Florida, and New York (2008-2018), and population prevalence data from the National Health Interview Surveys (2008-2018). Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) and regression-derived mortality rate ratios (MRRs) were computed. Pearson correlation analyses assessed the extent to which group-specific risk factor prevalence explained variability in observed AAMRs.
US-born Mexican Americans and American Indians had the highest rates and MRRs compared to Whites: 1.44 (95 %CI: 1.35-1.53) and 1.51 (1.38-1.64) for Mexican American men and women, respectively, and 1.54 (95 %CI: 1.25-1.89) and 1.53 (95 %CI: 1.15-2.04) for American Indians. In contrast, non-Mexican Hispanics had lower rates than Whites. Among males, positive correlations between AAMRs and smoking, obesity, and chronic kidney disease prevalence by race-ethnicity were found.
Mexican Americans and American Indians are high-risk for fatal kidney cancer. Disparities are only partially attributable to higher smoking and obesity prevalence, and more so among men than women. A shared risk factor profile, as well as possible genetic similarities, may explain their disproportionately higher kidney cancer mortality, but further research is warranted.",obesity,kidney cancer mortality disparity among hispanic u,kidney cancer incidence increasing among hispanic rate difference distinct group cuban puerto rican mexican studied fill knowledge gap use mortality data reflecting fatal kidney cancer examine pattern raceethnicity including detailed hispanic group correlate mortality rate group prevalence known kidney cancer risk factor smoking obesity hypertension diabetes chronic kidney disease used individuallevel death data california florida new york population prevalence data national health interview survey ageadjusted mortality rate aamrs regressionderived mortality rate ratio mrrs computed pearson correlation analysis assessed extent groupspecific risk factor prevalence explained variability observed aamrs usborn mexican american american indian highest rate mrrs compared white ci mexican american men woman respectively ci ci american indian contrast nonmexican hispanic lower rate white among male positive correlation aamrs smoking obesity chronic kidney disease prevalence raceethnicity found mexican american american indian highrisk fatal kidney cancer disparity partially attributable higher smoking obesity prevalence among men woman shared risk factor profile well possible genetic similarity may explain disproportionately higher kidney cancer mortality research warranted

Movement interventions that change the body composition and movement patterns is suggested as an effective way to minimise the childhood obesity adverse effects.
Whether a locomotion task constraints intervention is effective to change body composition, motor performance and running efficiency in overweight/obese boys with different levels of motor development.
Forty young boys (age: 8.21 ± 1.01 years) whose body mass index (BMI) was above the 85th normative ranked score were divided into 4 independent groups according to their development and BMI: intervention-typical, intervention-delay, control-typical and control-delay. A 6-week task constraints intervention with an emphasis on improving locomotion skills such as fast walking, running, jumping, hopping, skipping and leaping were carried out in the intervention group.
The pre and post-intervention difference score on the sample dependent variables showed decreases in body mass and BMI and improvements in agility, joint kinematics and running economy in the intervention-typical group relative to other groups.
The findings highlight that the boys with overweight/obesity and typical development can benefit more from a short-term developmentally-appropriate intervention to refine the running pattern and agility skill that was accompanied by positive changes in body composition.",obesity,effect locomotion task constraint running boy overweightobesity mediating role developmental delay,childhood obesity adversely affect musculoskeletal system accompanied motor development delay movement intervention change body composition movement pattern suggested effective way minimise childhood obesity adverse effect whether locomotion task constraint intervention effective change body composition motor performance running efficiency overweightobese boy different level motor development forty young boy age year whose body mass index bmi th normative ranked score divided independent group according development bmi interventiontypical interventiondelay controltypical controldelay week task constraint intervention emphasis improving locomotion skill fast walking running jumping hopping skipping leaping carried intervention group pre postintervention difference score sample dependent variable showed decrease body mass bmi improvement agility joint kinematics running economy interventiontypical group relative group finding highlight boy overweightobesity typical development benefit shortterm developmentallyappropriate intervention refine running pattern agility skill accompanied positive change body composition

5,33862225,Maternal and perinatal risk factors for pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A systematic review.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common pediatric liver disease. The intrauterine and early life environment can have an important impact on the long-term metabolic health. We investigated the impact of maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, (pre)gestational diabetes, breastfeeding and birth anthropometrics/preterm birth on the development of NAFLD in children and adolescents.
A comprehensive search was performed in MEDLINE, PubMed Central, EMBASE, and grey literature databases through August 2020. The primary outcome was the prevalence of pediatric NAFLD, while the histological severity of steatohepatitis and/or fibrosis were secondary outcomes. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers.
Our systematic review included 33 papers. Study heterogeneity regarding patient populations, diagnostic tools and overall quality was considerable. Eight studies determined the impact of maternal pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity and identified this as a possible modifiable risk factor for pediatric NAFLD. Conversely, eight studies investigated (pre-)gestational diabetes, yet the evidence on its impact is conflicting. Breastfeeding was associated with a reduced risk for NAFLD, steatohepatitis and fibrosis, especially in studies that evaluated longer periods of breastfeeding. Being born preterm or small for gestational age has an unclear impact on the development of NAFLD, although an early catch-up growth might drive NAFLD.
In a systematic review, we found that maternal pre-pregnancy overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of pediatric NAFLD. Breastfeeding might be protective against the development of NAFLD when the duration of breastfeeding is sufficiently long (≥6 months).",obesity,maternal perinatal risk factor pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease systematic review,nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld become common pediatric liver disease intrauterine early life environment important impact longterm metabolic health investigated impact maternal prepregnancy obesity pregestational diabetes breastfeeding birth anthropometricspreterm birth development nafld child adolescent comprehensive search performed medline pubmed central embase grey literature database august primary outcome prevalence pediatric nafld histological severity steatohepatitis andor fibrosis secondary outcome study selection data extraction quality assessment performed two independent reviewer systematic review included paper study heterogeneity regarding patient population diagnostic tool overall quality considerable eight study determined impact maternal prepregnancy overweightobesity identified possible modifiable risk factor pediatric nafld conversely eight study investigated pregestational diabetes yet evidence impact conflicting breastfeeding associated reduced risk nafld steatohepatitis fibrosis especially study evaluated longer period breastfeeding born preterm small gestational age unclear impact development nafld although early catchup growth might drive nafld systematic review found maternal prepregnancy overweight obesity associated increased risk pediatric nafld breastfeeding might protective development nafld duration breastfeeding sufficiently long month
6,33862221,AMPK signaling and its targeting in cancer progression and treatment.,"The intrinsic mechanisms sensing the imbalance of energy in cells are pivotal for cell survival under various environmental insults. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a central guardian maintaining energy homeostasis by orchestrating diverse cellular processes, such as lipogenesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, cell cycle progression and mitochondrial dynamics. Given that AMPK plays an essential role in the maintenance of energy balance and metabolism, managing AMPK activation is considered as a promising strategy for the treatment of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Since AMPK has been attributed to aberrant activation of metabolic pathways, mitochondrial dynamics and functions, and epigenetic regulation, which are hallmarks of cancer, targeting AMPK may open up a new avenue for cancer therapies. Although AMPK is previously thought to be involved in tumor suppression, several recent studies have unraveled its tumor promoting activity. The double-edged sword characteristics for AMPK as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene are determined by distinct cellular contexts. In this review, we will summarize recent progress in dissecting the upstream regulators and downstream effectors for AMPK, discuss the distinct roles of AMPK in cancer regulation and finally offer potential strategies with AMPK targeting in cancer therapy.",obesity,ampk signaling targeting cancer progression treatment,intrinsic mechanism sensing imbalance energy cell pivotal cell survival various environmental insult ampactivated protein kinase ampk serf central guardian maintaining energy homeostasis orchestrating diverse cellular process lipogenesis glycolysis tca cycle cell cycle progression mitochondrial dynamic given ampk play essential role maintenance energy balance metabolism managing ampk activation considered promising strategy treatment metabolic disorder type diabetes obesity since ampk attributed aberrant activation metabolic pathway mitochondrial dynamic function epigenetic regulation hallmark cancer targeting ampk may open new avenue cancer therapy although ampk previously thought involved tumor suppression several recent study unraveled tumor promoting activity doubleedged sword characteristic ampk tumor suppressor oncogene determined distinct cellular context review summarize recent progress dissecting upstream regulator downstream effector ampk discus distinct role ampk cancer regulation finally offer potential strategy ampk targeting cancer therapy

9,33862029,Converging vulnerability factors for compulsive food and drug use.,"Highly palatable foods and substance of abuse have intersecting neurobiological, metabolic and behavioral effects relevant for understanding vulnerability to conditions related to food (e.g., obesity, binge eating disorder) and drug (e.g., substance use disorder) misuse. Here, we review data from animal models, clinical populations and epidemiological evidence in behavioral, genetic, pathophysiologic and therapeutic domains. Results suggest that consumption of highly palatable food and drugs of abuse both impact and conversely are regulated by metabolic hormones and metabolic status. Palatable foods high in fat and/or sugar can elicit adaptation in brain reward and withdrawal circuitry akin to substances of abuse. Intake of or withdrawal from palatable food can impact behavioral sensitivity to drugs of abuse and vice versa. A robust literature suggests common substrates and roles for negative reinforcement, negative affect, negative urgency, and impulse control deficits, with both highly palatable foods and substances of abuse. Candidate genetic risk loci shared by obesity and alcohol use disorders have been identified in molecules classically associated with both metabolic and motivational functions. Finally, certain drugs may have overlapping therapeutic potential to treat obesity, diabetes, binge-related eating disorders and substance use disorders. Taken together, data are consistent with the hypotheses that compulsive food and substance use share overlapping, interacting substrates at neurobiological and metabolic levels and that motivated behavior associated with feeding or substance use might constitute vulnerability factors for one another.",obesity,converging vulnerability factor compulsive food drug use,highly palatable food substance abuse intersecting neurobiological metabolic behavioral effect relevant understanding vulnerability condition related food eg obesity binge eating disorder drug eg substance use disorder misuse review data animal model clinical population epidemiological evidence behavioral genetic pathophysiologic therapeutic domain result suggest consumption highly palatable food drug abuse impact conversely regulated metabolic hormone metabolic status palatable food high fat andor sugar elicit adaptation brain reward withdrawal circuitry akin substance abuse intake withdrawal palatable food impact behavioral sensitivity drug abuse vice versa robust literature suggests common substrate role negative reinforcement negative affect negative urgency impulse control deficit highly palatable food substance abuse candidate genetic risk locus shared obesity alcohol use disorder identified molecule classically associated metabolic motivational function finally certain drug may overlapping therapeutic potential treat obesity diabetes bingerelated eating disorder substance use disorder taken together data consistent hypothesis compulsive food substance use share overlapping interacting substrate neurobiological metabolic level motivated behavior associated feeding substance use might constitute vulnerability factor one another

We prepared three types of sea salt: generally manufactured sea salt (GS), generally manufactured after filtering seawater (FS), and manufactured with only new seawater (NS). Sea salt intake increased colon length and reduced colon length/weight ratio, tumor number, and progression of colon cancer in colon tissue. The differently prepared sea salts also ameliorated liver injury. In addition, the mineral composition of each salt was different. Moreover, the sea salts enhanced activation of natural killer cell (CD56) expression in colon and spleen tissues. However, the mineral compositions of sea salts were not simply associated with anticancer effects in AOM/DSS+HFD induced mice. Thus, the anticolorectal cancer effects of sea salts may be mediated by different factors, which remain to be identified.",obesity,shinan salt intake ameliorates colorectal cancer aomdss high fat dietinduced cbln mouse,anticancer effect shinan shinansouth korea salt azoxymethane aomdextran sodium sulfate ds high fat diet hfdinduced colon cancer obesity cbln mouse studied prepared three type salt generally manufactured salt g generally manufactured filtering seawater f manufactured new seawater n salt intake increased colon length reduced colon lengthweight ratio tumor number progression colon cancer colon tissue differently prepared salt also ameliorated liver injury addition mineral composition salt different moreover salt enhanced activation natural killer cell cd expression colon spleen tissue however mineral composition salt simply associated anticancer effect aomdsshfd induced mouse thus anticolorectal cancer effect salt may mediated different factor remain identified
12,33861860,Dysfunctional Brain Reward System in Child Obesity.,"Eating habits leading to obesity may reflect nonhomeostatic behavior based on excessive immediate-reward seeking. However, it is currently unknown to what extent excess weight is associated with functional alterations in the brain's reward system in children. We tested the integrity of reward circuits using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging in a population of 230 children aged 8-12 years. The major components of the reward system were identified within the ventral striatum network defined on the basis of the nucleus accumbens connectivity pattern. The functional structure of the cerebral cortex was characterized using a combination of local functional connectivity measures. Higher body mass index was associated with weaker connectivity between the cortical and subcortical elements of the reward system, and enhanced the integration of the sensorimotor cortex to superior parietal areas relevant to body image formation. Obese children, unlike WHO-defined overweight condition, showed functional structure alterations in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala region similar to those previously observed in primary obsessive-compulsive disorder and Prader-Willi syndrome associated with obsessive eating behavior. Results further support the view that childhood obesity is not simply a deviant habit with restricted physical health consequences but is associated with reward system dysfunction characterizing behavioral control disorders.",obesity,dysfunctional brain reward system child obesity,eating habit leading obesity may reflect nonhomeostatic behavior based excessive immediatereward seeking however currently unknown extent excess weight associated functional alteration brain reward system child tested integrity reward circuit using restingstate functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging population child aged year major component reward system identified within ventral striatum network defined basis nucleus accumbens connectivity pattern functional structure cerebral cortex characterized using combination local functional connectivity measure higher body mass index associated weaker connectivity cortical subcortical element reward system enhanced integration sensorimotor cortex superior parietal area relevant body image formation obese child unlike whodefined overweight condition showed functional structure alteration orbitofrontal cortex amygdala region similar previously observed primary obsessivecompulsive disorder praderwilli syndrome associated obsessive eating behavior result support view childhood obesity simply deviant habit restricted physical health consequence associated reward system dysfunction characterizing behavioral control disorder
13,33861844,Role of macrophage autophagy in atherosclerosis: modulation by bioactive compounds.,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with lipid metabolism disorder. Autophagy is a catabolic process and contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis. Substantial evidence suggests that defective autophagy is implicated in several diseases, including atherosclerosis, while increased autophagy mitigates atherosclerosis development. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of autophagy regulation and its association with atherosclerosis is vital to develop new therapies against atherosclerosis. Dietary bioactive compounds are non-nutrient natural compounds that include phenolics, flavonoids, and carotenoids. Importantly, these bioactive compounds possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties that may alleviate various chronic diseases. Recently, examining the effects of bioactive compounds on autophagy activity in atherogenesis has drawn considerable attention.

14,33861804,CT-based determination of excessive visceral adipose tissue is associated with an impaired survival in critically ill patients.,"Obesity is a negative prognostic factor for various clinical conditions. In this observational cohort study, we evaluated a CT-based assessment of the adipose tissue distribution as a potential non-invasive prognostic parameter in critical illness.
Routine CT-scans upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) were used to analyze the visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas at the 3rd lumbar vertebra in 155 patients. Results were correlated with various prognostic markers and both short-term- and overall survival. Multiple statistical tools were used for data analysis.
We observed a significantly larger visceral adipose tissue area in septic patients compared to non-sepsis patients. Interestingly, patients requiring mechanical ventilation had a significantly higher amount of visceral adipose tissue correlating with the duration of mechanical ventilation. Moreover, both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue area significantly correlated with several laboratory markers. While neither the visceral nor the subcutaneous adipose tissue area was predictive for short-term ICU survival, patients with a visceral adipose tissue area above the optimal cut-off (241.4 cm2) had a significantly impaired overall survival compared to patients with a lower visceral adipose tissue area.
Our study supports a prognostic role of the individual adipose tissue distribution in critically ill patients.

15,33861726,Hyperbaric oxygen therapy effectively alleviates D-galactose-induced-age-related cardiac dysfunction via attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction in pre-diabetic rats.,"Currently, the prevalence of obesity in aging populations is fast growing worldwide. Aging induced by D-galactose (D-gal) is proven to cause the worsening of cardiac dysfunction in pre-diabetic rats via deteriorating cardiac mitochondrial function. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been shown to attenuate D-gal-induced cognitive deterioration through decreased inflammation and apoptosis. We tested the hypothesis that HBOT alleviates D-gal induced cardiac dysfunction via improving mitochondrial function in pre-diabetic rats. Wistar rats (n=56) were fed normal diet or high-fat diet for 12 weeks. For subsequent 8 weeks, they were subcutaneously injected either vehicle (0.9% normal saline) or D-gal (150mg/kg/day). Rats were randomly subdivided into 7 groups at week 21: sham-treated (normal diet fed rats with vehicle (NDV), high-fat diet fed rats with vehicle (HFV), normal diet fed rats with D-gal (NDDg), high-fat diet fed rats with D-gal (HFDg)) and HBOT-treated (HFV, NDDg, HFDg). Sham rats received ambient pressure of oxygen while HBOT-treated ones received 100% oxygen given once daily for 60 minutes at 2 atmosphere absolute.

The aim of this paper is to compare the outcomes of simultaneous versus delayed mesh repair of umbilical hernia in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).
We retrospectively compared 2 groups of morbidly obese patients with small/medium periumbilical hernia (up to 4 cm) in a case-matched study: the first group underwent LSG with simultaneous periumbilical hernia repair; in the second, hernioplasty was performed after weight loss induced by LSG. Patients were matched at a 1:1 ratio according to age, comorbidities, defect size (<2 or ≥2 cm), and obesity grade (<40 or ≥40 kg/m). Demographic, clinical information, hernia size, data from the surgery, and its complications were retrieved and analyzed.
In total, 40 patients were retrieved from our prospectively maintained database and divided into 2 matched groups of 20 subjects each. Baseline characteristics were comparable. After a median time of 19.8±5.6 months, the recurrence rate was not significantly different in the 2 groups. There was no difference in the rate of single complications, but overall morbidity was significantly higher in patients undergoing a 2-step approach. LSG operation time and hospital stay resulted in comparable, but total hospital stay was longer for those readmitted for delayed hernioplasty.

17,33861444,Medicinal Plants and Phytochemicals Regulating Insulin Resistance and Glucose Homeostasis in Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A Clinical Review.,"Diabetes is a major health problem affecting more than four hundred million adults worldwide. The transition from normal glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes (T2D) is preceded by increased Insulin resistance (IR), an independent predictor of the development of T2D in high risk (e.g. obese populations, pre-diabetes) individuals. Insulin deficiency resulting from increased IR results in progressive glucose homeostasis dysfunction. Data has shown that IR is affected by many different factors such as genetics, age, exercise, dietary nutrients, obesity, and body fat distribution. One of the most important factors is diet, which plays an essential role in addressing T2D and metabolic syndrome. Nutraceuticals and medicinal plants have been shown to have efficacy in preventing chronic diseases like cancer, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome, likely through the anti-inflammatory properties found in nutraceuticals. However, the effect of these compounds, including traditional plant medicines, herbal formulations or their extracts on IR have not been systematically investigated.

18,33861434,"The Effect of Curcumin Phytosome on the Treatment of Patients with Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global health problem with increasing prevalence among overweight and obese patients. It is strongly associated with conditions of insulin resistance including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. It has detrimental consequences ranged from simple steatosis to irreversible hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Curcumin is a dietary polyphenol with potential effect in improving NAFLD. Therefore, the aim of this trial was to examine the effect of curcumin supplementation on various aspects of NAFLD. In this trial, a total number of 80 patients were randomised to receive either curcumin at 250 mg daily or placebo for 2 months. Lipid profiles, hepatic enzymes, anthropometric indices and hepatic fat mass were assessed at the baseline and the end of the trial, and compared within the groups. The grade of hepatic steatosis, and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were significantly reduced in the curcumin group (p = 0.015 and p = 0.007, respectively) compared to the placebo. There was also a significant reduction in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and anthropometric indices in both groups with no significant differences between the two groups. Low dose phospholipid curcumin supplementation each day for 2 months showed significant reduction in hepatic steatosis and enzymes in patients with NAFLD compared to placebo.

19,33861432,"The Effect of Curcumin Supplementation on Pulse Wave Velocity in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.","Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in many societies. Arterial stiffness is an initial sign of structural and functional changes in the arterial wall. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is the gold standard for non-invasive evaluation of aortic stiffness and a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Curcumin is a major component of turmeric with known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. Since arterial stiffness is affected by inflammation and oxidative stress, it may be improved by curcumin supplementation. The purpose of this clinical trial was to investigate the potential effects of curcumin on improving arterial stiffness in patients with metabolic syndrome. This placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted among metabolic syndrome patients. Sixty-six eligible individuals were randomly assigned to active intervention or control groups. The active intervention group received curcumin supplement at a dose of 500 mg daily for 12 weeks, whereas the control group received placebo capsule. Physical activity, daily dietary energy intake, anthropometric body composition, and biochemical hemodynamic and arterial stiffness parameters were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the study. Body weight decreased significantly in the curcumin group compared to placebo. Also, curcumin intervention improved PWV, which remained significant after adjustment for potential confounding factors (p = 0.011).

A diet supplemented with Plantago psyllium has been shown to be effective in reducing LDL-C and IL-6 in adolescents. However, there are no studies that have explored small-dense LDL (sdLDL) or HDL subclasses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a fiber dietary intervention on LDL and HDL subclasses in adolescents with obesity. In this parallel, double blind, randomized clinical trial, the participants were assigned to Plantago psyllium or placebo (10g/day for 7 weeks). We randomized 113 participants, and evaluated and analyzed 100 adolescents (50 in each group), 15 to 19 years with a body mass index of 29-34. We measured biochemical markers LDL and HDL subclasses using the Lipoprint system (Quantimetrix) and IL-6 by ELISA. Post-treatment there was a decrease in sdLDL between the groups 2.0 (0-5.0) vs 1 (0-3.0) mg/dl (p = 0.004), IL-6 median 3.32 (1.24-5.96) vs 1.76 (0.54-3.28) pg/ml, p <0.0001.

This study aimed to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and early childhood caries (ECC) among pre-school children.
This population-based retrospective study involves all 5-year-old children who resided in northern New Zealand and received school entry dental examinations between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2015. ECC status was determined with the decayed missing filled teeth (dmft) score obtained from a routinely collected regional dental data set. Objectively measured BMI information was obtained from the 'Before School Check' (B4SC) Programme. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between BMI and the occurrence of ECC (dmft score ≥ 1). Ethnic subgroup analyses were also conducted.
Of the 27 333 children involved in this analysis, 11 173 (40.9%) had ECC with a mean dmft score of 1.85, and 3948 (14.4%) were overweight and 2964 (10.8%) were obese at school entry.

28,33860943,Weight Gain and Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Adolescents with Down Syndrome.,"To determine whether the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is affected by weight gain velocity (WGV) in adolescents with Down syndrome.
Retrospective case series.
We performed a retrospective case series of children with Down syndrome, aged 9-19, referred for polysomnography (PSG) due to suspected OSA at an academic children's hospital. We determined the velocity (slope of change) of yearly weight gain using a mixed effect linear regression model. Subsequently, we determined if velocity of yearly weight gain was greater in adolescents with severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index > 10). Significance was set at P < .05.
A total of 77 adolescents with Down syndrome were identified. The average age was 12.5 years (standard deviation = 3.1); 44 (57%) were male and 46 (60%) were Hispanic. The majority, 51 (66%) had severe OSA. The velocity of yearly weight gain prior to PSG in Down syndrome adolescents was similar regardless of OSA severity (mean diff in weight gain at PSG between severe and nonsevere OSA = -1.42, 95% confidence interval = -5.8 to 2.9, P = .52). Down syndrome adolescents with severe OSA weighed more at PSG (58.4 kg vs. 40.9 kg, P < .001) and all years prior to PSG. These findings remained even when controlling for age at PSG.
Severe OSA in adolescents with Down syndrome is associated with weight. There was no significant difference in WGV in children with Down syndrome with or without severe OSA.

31,33860465,Development and validation of the Child Weight Risk Questionnaire.,"The study objective was to develop and validate a measure of parent perception of child weight-related risk, the Child Weight Risk Questionnaire (CWRQ), among a sample of US parents.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a sample of 216 parents of 6- to 12-year-old children who were overweight. The CWRQ was used to assess parent beliefs about their child's susceptibility to physical, social-emotional, and behavioral health problems due to weight.
Confirmatory factor analysis supported the three-factor structure of the CWRQ and acceptable fit was achieved. The internal consistency of the measure was excellent. Convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity analyses provided initial evidence for CWRQ validity.
The CWRQ is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing parent perception of child weight-related risk. This measure could be utilized in research and applied settings to capture the multifaceted nature of parent risk perception and support efforts to tailor family weight interventions in ways that align with parent beliefs.

33,33860453,Tsukushi and TSKU genotype in obesity and related metabolic disorders.,"Whether Tsukushi (TSK) can protect against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and improve glucose metabolism remains controversial. Serum levels of TSK in the population have not been reported until now. We assessed the association among TSK level, TSKU genotype, and metabolic traits in humans.
Associations between serum TSK levels and metabolic traits were assessed in 144 Han Chinese individuals. Loci in the TSKU gene region were further genotyped in 11,022 individuals. The association between the loci and serum TSK level was evaluated using the additive genetic model. The association between the loci and their metabolic traits in humans were also verified.
Lower TSK levels were observed in obese subjects than in control subjects (median and interquartile range 17.78:12.07-23.28 vs. 23.81:12.54-34.56, P < 0.05). However, in obese subjects, TSK was positively associated with BMI (β ± SE: 0.63 ± 0.31, P = 0.049), visceral fat area (β ± SE: 12.15 ± 5.94, P = 0.011), and deterioration of glucose metabolism. We found that rs11236956 was associated with TSK level in obese subjects (β 95% CI 0.17, 0.07-0.26; P = 0.0007). There was also a significant association between rs11236956 and metabolic traits in our population.
Our findings showed that serum TSK levels were associated with metabolic disorders in obese subjects.

34,33860214,"Differential Therapeutic Effects of FXR Activation, sEH Inhibition, and Dual FXR/sEH Modulation in NASH in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an epidemic chronic liver disease and may progress over nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The multiple metabolic, environmental, and genetic factors that are involved in NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis and progression suggest a need for multimechanistic interventions. We have developed and preliminarily characterized a concept of dual farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) modulation as a promising polypharmacological strategy to counteract NASH. Here we report the profiling of FXR activation, sEH inhibition, and simultaneous FXR/sEH modulation as an interventional treatment in pre-established NASH in mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO). We found that full FXR activation was required to obtain antisteatosis effects but also worsened ballooning degeneration and fibrosis. In contrast, sEH inhibition and dual FXR/sEH modulation, despite a lack of antisteatosis activity, had anti-inflammatory effects and efficiently counteracted hepatic fibrosis. These results demonstrate great therapeutic potential of sEH inhibition to counteract hepatic fibrosis and validate the designed polypharmacology concept of dual FXR/sEH modulation as a potentially superior avenue for the effective treatment of the multifactorial condition NASH.",obesity,differential therapeutic effect fxr activation seh inhibition dual fxrseh modulation nash dietinduced obese mouse,nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld epidemic chronic liver disease may progress nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma multiple metabolic environmental genetic factor involved nafldnash pathogenesis progression suggest need multimechanistic intervention developed preliminarily characterized concept dual farnesoid x receptor fxr soluble epoxide hydrolase seh modulation promising polypharmacological strategy counteract nash report profiling fxr activation seh inhibition simultaneous fxrseh modulation interventional treatment preestablished nash mouse dietinduced obesity dio found full fxr activation required obtain antisteatosis effect also worsened ballooning degeneration fibrosis contrast seh inhibition dual fxrseh modulation despite lack antisteatosis activity antiinflammatory effect efficiently counteracted hepatic fibrosis result demonstrate great therapeutic potential seh inhibition counteract hepatic fibrosis validate designed polypharmacology concept dual fxrseh modulation potentially superior avenue effective treatment multifactorial condition nash
35,33860201,Identification of Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Human Inositol Hexakisphosphate Kinases by High-Throughput Screening.,"Inositol hexakisphosphate kinases (IP6Ks) catalyze pyrophosphorylation of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) into inositol 5-diphospho-1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate (IP7), which is involved in numerous areas of cell physiology including glucose homeostasis, blood coagulation, and neurological development. Inhibition of IP6Ks may be effective for the treatment of Type II diabetes, obesity, metabolic complications, thrombosis, and psychiatric disorders. We performed a high-throughput screen (HTS) of 158 410 compounds for IP6K1 inhibitors using a previously developed ADP-Glo Max assay. Of these, 1206 compounds were found to inhibit IP6K1 kinase activity by more than 25%, representing a 0.8% hit rate. Structural clustering analysis of HTS-active compounds, which were confirmed in the dose-response testing using the same kinase assay, revealed diverse clusters that were feasible for future structure-activity relationship (SAR) optimization to potent IP6K inhibitors. Medicinal chemistry SAR efforts in three chemical series identified potent IP6K1 inhibitors which were further validated in an orthogonal LC-MS IP7 analysis. The effects of IP6K1 inhibitors on cellular IP7 levels were further confirmed and were found to correlate with cellular IP6K1 binding measured by a high-throughput cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA).",obesity,identification smallmolecule inhibitor human inositol hexakisphosphate kinase highthroughput screening,inositol hexakisphosphate kinase ipks catalyze pyrophosphorylation inositol hexakisphosphate ip inositol diphosphopentakisphosphate ip involved numerous area cell physiology including glucose homeostasis blood coagulation neurological development inhibition ipks may effective treatment type ii diabetes obesity metabolic complication thrombosis psychiatric disorder performed highthroughput screen hts compound ipk inhibitor using previously developed adpglo max assay compound found inhibit ipk kinase activity representing hit rate structural clustering analysis htsactive compound confirmed doseresponse testing using kinase assay revealed diverse cluster feasible future structureactivity relationship sar optimization potent ipk inhibitor medicinal chemistry sar effort three chemical series identified potent ipk inhibitor validated orthogonal lcm ip analysis effect ipk inhibitor cellular ip level confirmed found correlate cellular ipk binding measured highthroughput cellular thermal shift assay cetsa
36,33860199,Peripherally Selective CB1 Receptor Antagonist Improves Symptoms of Metabolic Syndrome in Mice.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex disorder that stems from the additive effects of multiple underlying causes such as obesity, insulin resistance, and chronic low-grade inflammation. The endocannabinoid system plays a central role in appetite regulation, energy balance, lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and β-cell function. The type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) antagonist SR141716A (rimonabant) showed promising antiobesity effects, but its use was discontinued due to adverse psychiatric events in some users. These adverse effects are due to antagonism of CB1R in the central nervous system (CNS). As such, CNS-sparing CB1R antagonists are presently being developed for various indications.

37,33860188,Pyruvate Dehydrogenase as a Therapeutic Target for Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,"Excess caloric intake combined with a sedentary lifestyle in the general population has greatly increased the prevalence of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is defined as the accumulation of excess fat in the liver in the absence of alcohol abuse or other attributable causes such as infection with hepatitis C. Furthermore, NAFLD increases the risk for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cardiovascular disease, while currently having no approved therapy to counteract its pathology. Thus, increasing efforts to understand the mechanisms responsible for NAFLD have been pursued in preclinical studies, in the hopes of developing novel therapies that can prevent the progression of insulin resistance and/or T2D. The pathology of NAFLD is multifactorial, with proposed mechanisms including inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction to name a few. The latter remains a subject of ongoing debate, but may be attributed to impaired hepatic fatty acid oxidation, thereby increasing the accumulation of triacylglycerol within hepatocytes. More recent studies have also demonstrated that the mitochondrial dysfunction in NAFLD may also encompass impairments in glucose oxidation, despite oxidative energy production having minimal contribution to overall glucose/pyruvate metabolism in the liver. Accordingly, strategies to reverse this defect in glucose oxidation can ameliorate hepatic steatosis and improve glucose homeostasis. We will review herein the evidence supporting impaired hepatic glucose oxidation as a mechanism of NAFLD, while discussing the validity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), the rate-limiting enzyme of glucose oxidation, as a potential target for NAFLD. In addition, we will discuss potential mechanisms of action by which increased hepatic PDH activity and subsequent glucose oxidation can reverse the pathology of obesity-induced NAFLD, as well as opportunities to target this pathway with clinical agents.",obesity,pyruvate dehydrogenase therapeutic target nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,excess caloric intake combined sedentary lifestyle general population greatly increased prevalence obesity nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld defined accumulation excess fat liver absence alcohol abuse attributable cause infection hepatitis c furthermore nafld increase risk insulin resistance type diabetes td cardiovascular disease currently approved therapy counteract pathology thus increasing effort understand mechanism responsible nafld pursued preclinical study hope developing novel therapy prevent progression insulin resistance andor td pathology nafld multifactorial proposed mechanism including inflammation oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction name latter remains subject ongoing debate may attributed impaired hepatic fatty acid oxidation thereby increasing accumulation triacylglycerol within hepatocytes recent study also demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction nafld may also encompass impairment glucose oxidation despite oxidative energy production minimal contribution overall glucosepyruvate metabolism liver accordingly strategy reverse defect glucose oxidation ameliorate hepatic steatosis improve glucose homeostasis review herein evidence supporting impaired hepatic glucose oxidation mechanism nafld discussing validity pyruvate dehydrogenase pdh ratelimiting enzyme glucose oxidation potential target nafld addition discus potential mechanism action increased hepatic pdh activity subsequent glucose oxidation reverse pathology obesityinduced nafld well opportunity target pathway clinical agent

Several studies have shown the mechanisms by which some bacteria may influence the development of colorectal cancer; however, gut microbiome characteristics in obese patients with colorectal cancer remain unclear. Therefore, this study evaluated their gut microbiome profile and its relationship with metabolic markers.
The study assessed fecal samples from 36 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer and 38 controls without colorectal cancer. To identify microbiotic variations between patients with colorectal cancer and controls, as well as between nonobese and obese individuals, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed.

40,33860057,Health Behavior and Lifestyle Trends among Platelet Donors: Results from a Questionnaire-Based Survey in Norway.,"Blood donors are on average healthier than the general population, a phenomenon known as the ""healthy donor effect."" Earlier studies have also pointed to healthier behaviors among whole blood donors than the general population. This study is aimed at assessing the prevalence of four healthy behaviors (sufficient physical activity, avoiding cigarette smoking, low to moderate alcohol use, and maintaining a healthy weight) among platelet donors and to compare the results with those in the general population of similar ages.
Eighty-six platelet donors were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to assess physical activity, smoking, and alcohol use. Sociodemographic information including gender, age, and education was also collected from all participants. Chi-square statistics and logistic regression were used in statistical analysis.
The mean age of the study donors was 51 years, 56% were female. Most were employed (90%), and 48% hold a bachelor's or higher degree. The prevalence of healthy behaviors differed by education gradients but not by gender and age. About 49% of the donors met the weekly physical activity recommendations, less than 5% were daily smokers, and~26% were classified as more frequent drinkers (≥1 to ≤5 times per week). The corresponding percentages for the general population were, respectively, 33%, 13%, and 35%. The prevalence of overweight and obesity, as assessed by body mass index (BMI), among donors were 50% and 29%, respectively, much higher than the current prevalence of overweight and obesity of 37% and 19%, respectively, among adults in the general population.
The individual health behaviors of the majority of the study population could be characterized by a relatively high level of physical activity, low prevalence of daily smoking, and moderate alcohol drinking. The above-average overweight/obesity prevalence among platelet donors in this cohort is of concern because of the potential serious health consequences and it warrants further reflection.",obesity,health behavior lifestyle trend among platelet donor result questionnairebased survey norway,blood donor average healthier general population phenomenon known healthy donor effect earlier study also pointed healthier behavior among whole blood donor general population study aimed assessing prevalence four healthy behavior sufficient physical activity avoiding cigarette smoking low moderate alcohol use maintaining healthy weight among platelet donor compare result general population similar age eightysix platelet donor asked complete questionnaire designed ass physical activity smoking alcohol use sociodemographic information including gender age education also collected participant chisquare statistic logistic regression used statistical analysis mean age study donor year female employed hold bachelor higher degree prevalence healthy behavior differed education gradient gender age donor met weekly physical activity recommendation le daily smoker classified frequent drinker time per week corresponding percentage general population respectively prevalence overweight obesity assessed body mass index bmi among donor respectively much higher current prevalence overweight obesity respectively among adult general population individual health behavior majority study population could characterized relatively high level physical activity low prevalence daily smoking moderate alcohol drinking aboveaverage overweightobesity prevalence among platelet donor cohort concern potential serious health consequence warrant reflection
41,33859962,Toxicity Evaluation by Single and Repeated Administration of Yeast Hydrolysate DNF-10.,"This study aimed at investigating the acute and subacute oral toxicity of yeast hydrolysate (DNF-10) in Sprague-Dawley rats. To determine the acute toxicity of DNF-10, it was orally administered to rats at a dose of 5,000 mg/kg. Furthermore, to determine subacute toxicity of DNF-10, it was orally administered to female and male rats at a dose of 1,000 mg/kg for 90 days. In the acute toxicity test, the experimental group did not show changes in body and organ weights compared to the corresponding weights in the control group. When compared to female controls, the DNF-10-treated female rats showed decreased red blood cell counts, haemoglobin, and total bilirubin levels; however, the parameters remained within the normal range. In the subacute toxicity test, DNF-10 administration significantly reduced body weight among male rats, which appears attributable to the anti-obesity effect of the compound. In the experimental groups, significant differences in some haematological parameters were considered as non-toxic because the results were within the normal range. These results suggest that DNF-10 is safe and non-toxic at single doses (5,000 mg/kg) and repeated doses (1,000 mg/kg).",obesity,toxicity evaluation single repeated administration yeast hydrolysate dnf,study aimed investigating acute subacute oral toxicity yeast hydrolysate dnf spraguedawley rat determine acute toxicity dnf orally administered rat dose mgkg furthermore determine subacute toxicity dnf orally administered female male rat dose mgkg day acute toxicity test experimental group show change body organ weight compared corresponding weight control group compared female control dnftreated female rat showed decreased red blood cell count haemoglobin total bilirubin level however parameter remained within normal range subacute toxicity test dnf administration significantly reduced body weight among male rat appears attributable antiobesity effect compound experimental group significant difference haematological parameter considered nontoxic result within normal range result suggest dnf safe nontoxic single dos mgkg repeated dos mgkg
42,33859943,Obese Adipose Tissue as a Driver of Breast Cancer Growth and Development: Update and Emerging Evidence.,"Obesity is an established risk factor for breast cancer growth and progression. A number of advances have been made in recent years revealing new insights into this link. Early events in breast cancer development involve the neoplastic transformation of breast epithelial cells to cancer cells. In obesity, breast adipose tissue undergoes significant hormonal and inflammatory changes that create a mitogenic microenvironment. Many factors that are produced in obesity have also been shown to promote tumorigenesis. Given that breast epithelial cells are surrounded by adipose tissue, the crosstalk between the adipose compartment and breast epithelial cells is hypothesized to be a significant player in the initiation and progression of breast cancer in individuals with excess adiposity. The present review examines this crosstalk with a focus on obese breast adipose-derived estrogen, inflammatory mediators and adipokines, and how they are mechanistically linked to breast cancer risk and growth through stimulation of oxidative stress, DNA damage, and pro-oncogenic transcriptional programs. Pharmacological and lifestyle strategies targeting these factors and their downstream effects are evaluated for feasibility and efficacy in decreasing the risk of obesity-induced breast epithelial cell transformation and consequently, breast cancer development.",obesity,obese adipose tissue driver breast cancer growth development update emerging evidence,obesity established risk factor breast cancer growth progression number advance made recent year revealing new insight link early event breast cancer development involve neoplastic transformation breast epithelial cell cancer cell obesity breast adipose tissue undergoes significant hormonal inflammatory change create mitogenic microenvironment many factor produced obesity also shown promote tumorigenesis given breast epithelial cell surrounded adipose tissue crosstalk adipose compartment breast epithelial cell hypothesized significant player initiation progression breast cancer individual excess adiposity present review examines crosstalk focus obese breast adiposederived estrogen inflammatory mediator adipokines mechanistically linked breast cancer risk growth stimulation oxidative stress dna damage prooncogenic transcriptional program pharmacological lifestyle strategy targeting factor downstream effect evaluated feasibility efficacy decreasing risk obesityinduced breast epithelial cell transformation consequently breast cancer development
43,33859907,Prompting a Fresh Start for Adults With Food Insecurity and Increased BMI: A Case Series of Four Patients in a Food Prescription Program.,"Estimates place low intake of fruits and vegetables, physical inactivity, and high BMI (overweight-obesity) as all in the top 12 causes of death. Food and dietary education are becoming a focus in how we approach disease prevention and management, and food prescription programs in particular are showing promise, especially in under-resourced, food-insecure communities. This paper describes a pilot food prescription program in a handful of uninsured patients enrolled in an interprofessional clinical and educational program of a medical school in South Florida. This case series of four patients struggling with food insecurity profiles the demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants and provides the results of standardized assessments of their dietary behaviors, physical activity levels, and attitudes toward food before and after the intervention. This four-month pilot food prescription program, Fresh Start Food Rx, involved a prospective case report of four patients seen on a mobile health center (MHC) for uninsured patients in South Miami, Florida. The MHC is part of an interprofessional health professions education, health care, and social service program of the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine at Florida International University called the Neighborhood Health Education Learning Program (NeighborhoodHELP). A systematic review of South Miami MHC patient electronic medical records identified eligible participants for the program: patients with food insecurity and a BMI >30, with comorbid health conditions. Patients with greater BMI and more comorbidities were prioritized. Once enrolled, we provided biweekly packages of fresh fruits and vegetables along with monthly dietary education to the participants. Key measures included self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption, attitude toward healthy eating, and level of activity. Pre- and post-intervention focus groups assessed barriers the participants faced to eating healthy and pursuing physical activity, satisfaction with the program, feedback on strengths and weaknesses, and anticipated behavioral changes after completion of the program. Prior to the intervention, participants reported eating fruits on an average of 4.5 days out of the week. Post-survey answers increased to 5.0 days per week. Though the average amount of days per week that participants reported eating vegetables decreased slightly, the average number of vegetable servings that participants reported eating in a week increased. At termination of the program, most participants agreed that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is good for you, that it is important to eat fruits and vegetables every day, and that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can protect against cancer. This case study demonstrates that easier access to healthy foods, such as fresh produce delivery, and regular health education have the potential to promote healthier attitudes toward foods like fruits and vegetables. This change in attitude can then influence behavior, such as choosing to try new produce or increasing the amount and frequency of produce consumption. With the lessons learned from this small pilot program, the authors helped facilitate the expansion of a larger food prescription program in conjunction with a community partner hospital in the area. Findings from this experience might prove useful for others attempting to develop or expand a food prescription and health education program of their own.",obesity,prompting fresh start adult food insecurity increased bmi case series four patient food prescription program,estimate place low intake fruit vegetable physical inactivity high bmi overweightobesity top cause death food dietary education becoming focus approach disease prevention management food prescription program particular showing promise especially underresourced foodinsecure community paper describes pilot food prescription program handful uninsured patient enrolled interprofessional clinical educational program medical school south florida case series four patient struggling food insecurity profile demographic clinical characteristic participant provides result standardized assessment dietary behavior physical activity level attitude toward food intervention fourmonth pilot food prescription program fresh start food rx involved prospective case report four patient seen mobile health center mhc uninsured patient south miami florida mhc part interprofessional health profession education health care social service program herbert wertheim college medicine florida international university called neighborhood health education learning program neighborhoodhelp systematic review south miami mhc patient electronic medical record identified eligible participant program patient food insecurity bmi comorbid health condition patient greater bmi comorbidities prioritized enrolled provided biweekly package fresh fruit vegetable along monthly dietary education participant key measure included selfreported fruit vegetable consumption attitude toward healthy eating level activity pre postintervention focus group assessed barrier participant faced eating healthy pursuing physical activity satisfaction program feedback strength weakness anticipated behavioral change completion program prior intervention participant reported eating fruit average day week postsurvey answer increased day per week though average amount day per week participant reported eating vegetable decreased slightly average number vegetable serving participant reported eating week increased termination program participant agreed diet rich fruit vegetable good important eat fruit vegetable every day diet rich fruit vegetable protect cancer case study demonstrates easier access healthy food fresh produce delivery regular health education potential promote healthier attitude toward food like fruit vegetable change attitude influence behavior choosing try new produce increasing amount frequency produce consumption lesson learned small pilot program author helped facilitate expansion larger food prescription program conjunction community partner hospital area finding experience might prove useful others attempting develop expand food prescription health education program
44,33859902,Patterns of Abnormal Glucose Metabolism in Acromegaly and Impact of Treatment Modalities on Glucose Metabolism.," Chronic exposure to high levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) leads to metabolic complications, most importantly dysglycemia in the form of diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes. Dysglycemia if diagnosed early in the course of the disease can decrease complications. Treatment modalities in the form of surgery and medical therapy have varied impacts on glucose metabolism.
To determine the frequency of diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, and impaired fasting glucose in Pakistani patients with acromegaly and to establish the impact of the intervention (surgery/medical) on glucose metabolism.
This study was a retrospective review of patient records. Eighty-nine patients fulfilling the Endocrine Society criteria for acromegaly diagnosis were included. A data of baseline, GH, IGF-1 level, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and random blood glucose (RBS) levels were reviewed before and after the intervention (surgery/medical therapy). Normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and diabetes mellitus (DM) were defined based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. Patients were grouped into normoglycemic (NGT) and dysglycemic (IFG, IGT, and DM) based on FBG, RBS, and HbA1C.
Major risk factors for dysglycemia included age (15-45 years), male sex (33.70%), obesity (45.7%), and macroadenoma (77.52%). Both mean GH levels (58.29 vs. 54.36 ng/dl) and IGF-1 levels (862.98 vs. 824.32 ng/dl) were higher among the normoglycemic than dysglycemia. Pre-surgery NGT, IFG, IGT, IFG, and IGT/DM combined were found in 48.31%, 5.61%, 1.1%, 5.61%, and 39.32% of the subjects respectively. Post-surgery, HbA1C improved in 79.5%, deteriorated in 6.8%, and remained the same in 13.6%. Similarly, it improved in 67% post-medical therapy. Both FBG and RBS improved post-surgery and medical therapy. Further, the number of anti-diabetic drugs used also decreased post-surgery.
Dysglycemia is more common among patients with acromegaly as compared to the general population and tends to be poorly controlled in untreated acromegaly.

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics on body weight, body mass index (BMI), percentage of the excess weight loss (%EWL), waist circumference (WC), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in adults with obesity after bariatric surgery (BS). PUBMED, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials were searched from the earliest record to March 2020. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of probiotics in adults with obesity after bariatric surgery were analyzed according to the eligibility criteria. Four RCTs, including 172 participants, were analyzed. There was a statistically significant difference in probiotics in the reduction of waist circumference at 12 months after bariatric surgery. However, probiotics were not effective in weight, BMI, %EWL, WC, and CRP both within 3 months and at 12 months postoperation. Probiotics aid adults with morbid obesity in achieving further waist circumference improvement after BS, with no significant effect on weight, BMI, %EWL, and CRP.

48,33859689,Thyroid Dysfunction and Dysmetabolic Syndrome: The Need for Enhanced Thyrovigilance Strategies.,"Thyroid dysfunction (TD) is common in metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, kidney and liver dysfunctions, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo) worsens glycemic control in patients with DM, and these patients, especially those with Type-1DM, have higher prevalence of TD. Both TD and DM increase CVD risk. Even minor alteration in thyroid hormone (TH) levels can alter cardiovascular function. While hyperthyroidism increases systolic blood pressure and leads to high-output heart failure, hypothyroidism increases diastolic blood pressure and leads to low-output heart failure. Chronic subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper) and SHypo both increase the risk of hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD) events, CAD deaths, and total deaths. SHyper alters cardiac morphology and function. SHypo causes dyslipidemia and endothelial dysfunction and increases the risk for weight gain and obesity. Overweight and obese patients often have hyperleptinemia, which increases the secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and induces TD. Dyslipidemia associated with TD can increase serum uric acid levels. Hyperuricemia promotes inflammation and may increase the risk for dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and CVD. TD increases the risk for developing chronic kidney disease. In nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria is associated with urinary loss of TH leading to TD. Some correlation between TD and severity of liver disease is also seen. TD and PCOS have common risk factors and pathophysiological abnormalities. Hypothyroidism must be excluded before diagnosing PCOS. Current guidelines do not strongly recommend thyroid screening in the presence of all metabolic disorders. However, pragmatic thyrovigilance is required. Clinicians must stay alert to signs and symptoms of TD, maintain high clinical suspicion, and investigate thoroughly. Drug-induced TD should be considered when TH levels do not match clinical findings or when patients are on medications that can alter thyroid function.",obesity,thyroid dysfunction dysmetabolic syndrome need enhanced thyrovigilance strategy,thyroid dysfunction td common metabolic disorder diabetes mellitus dm cardiovascular disease cvd obesity dyslipidemia hyperuricemia kidney liver dysfunction polycystic ovary syndrome pcos subclinical hypothyroidism shypo worsens glycemic control patient dm patient especially typedm higher prevalence td td dm increase cvd risk even minor alteration thyroid hormone th level alter cardiovascular function hyperthyroidism increase systolic blood pressure lead highoutput heart failure hypothyroidism increase diastolic blood pressure lead lowoutput heart failure chronic subclinical hyperthyroidism shyper shypo increase risk hypertension coronary artery disease cad event cad death total death shyper alters cardiac morphology function shypo cause dyslipidemia endothelial dysfunction increase risk weight gain obesity overweight obese patient often hyperleptinemia increase secretion thyroid stimulating hormone tsh induces td dyslipidemia associated td increase serum uric acid level hyperuricemia promotes inflammation may increase risk dyslipidemia atherosclerosis cvd td increase risk developing chronic kidney disease nephrotic syndrome proteinuria associated urinary loss th leading td correlation td severity liver disease also seen td pcos common risk factor pathophysiological abnormality hypothyroidism must excluded diagnosing pcos current guideline strongly recommend thyroid screening presence metabolic disorder however pragmatic thyrovigilance required clinician must stay alert sign symptom td maintain high clinical suspicion investigate thoroughly druginduced td considered th level match clinical finding patient medication alter thyroid function

Furthermore, COVID-19 pandemic joins the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome in western countries. Patients suffering from obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, cardiac involvement and metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) have enhanced risk of suffering severe COVID-19 and mortality. Importantly, up to 25% of the population in western countries is susceptible of suffering from both MAFLD and COVID-19, while none approved treatment is currently available for any of them. Moreover, it is well known that exacerbated innate immune responses are key in the development of the most severe stages of MAFLD and COVID-19. In this review, we focus on the role of the immune system in the establishment and progression of MAFLD and discuss its potential implication in the development of severe COVID-19 in MAFLD patients. As a result, we hope to clarify their common pathology, but also uncover new potential therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for further research.",obesity,innate adaptive immunity alteration metabolic associated fatty liver disease implication covid severity,coronavirus infectious disease covid pandemic hit world affecting health medical care economy society whole furthermore covid pandemic join increasing prevalence metabolic syndrome western country patient suffering obesity type ii diabetes mellitus cardiac involvement metabolic associated fatty liver disease mafld enhanced risk suffering severe covid mortality importantly population western country susceptible suffering mafld covid none approved treatment currently available moreover well known exacerbated innate immune response key development severe stage mafld covid review focus role immune system establishment progression mafld discus potential implication development severe covid mafld patient result hope clarify common pathology also uncover new potential therapeutic target prognostic biomarkers research
51,33859622,D-Chiro-Inositol Regulates Insulin Signaling in Human Adipocytes.,"D-Chiro-Inositol (D-Chiro-Ins) is a secondary messenger in the insulin signaling pathway. D-Chiro-Ins modulates insulin secretion, the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and glycogen storage. Due to these actions D-Chiro-Ins has been proposed to correct defective insulin function in a variety of conditions characterized by metabolic dysfunction, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obesity, gestational diabetes and fat accumulation at menopause. Since it is unclear whether D-Chiro-Ins directly acts on adipocytes, we aimed to study D-Chiro-Ins's actions on adipocyte viability, proliferation, differentiation, and insulin-related protein expression using a human adipocyte cell line derived from Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) which fully differentiates to mature adipocytes. Throughout differentiation, cells were treated with D-Chiro-Ins, 17β-estradiol (E2) or Insulin. Cell viability and proliferation were not affected by D-Chiro-Ins, then D-Chiro-Ins promoted cell differentiation only during the final days of the process, while E2 enhanced it from the first phases. D-Chiro-Ins stimulated lipid storage and the production of big lipid droplets, thus reducing the content of free fatty acids. We also found that D-Chiro-Ins, either alone or in combination with insulin and E2 increased the expression and activation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4). In conclusion, this work shows that D-Chiro-Ins plays a direct role in the differentiation and in the function of human adipocytes, where it synergizes with insulin and estrogen through the recruitment of signal transduction pathways involved in lipid and glucose storage. These findings give clear insights to better understand the actions of D-Chiro-Ins on fat metabolism in women in physiology and in a variety of diseases.",obesity,dchiroinositol regulates insulin signaling human adipocytes,dchiroinositol dchiroins secondary messenger insulin signaling pathway dchiroins modulates insulin secretion mitochondrial respiratory chain glycogen storage due action dchiroins proposed correct defective insulin function variety condition characterized metabolic dysfunction polycystic ovary syndrome pcos obesity gestational diabetes fat accumulation menopause since unclear whether dchiroins directly act adipocytes aimed study dchiroinss action adipocyte viability proliferation differentiation insulinrelated protein expression using human adipocyte cell line derived simpsongolabibehmel syndrome sgbs fully differentiates mature adipocytes throughout differentiation cell treated dchiroins βestradiol insulin cell viability proliferation affected dchiroins dchiroins promoted cell differentiation final day process enhanced first phase dchiroins stimulated lipid storage production big lipid droplet thus reducing content free fatty acid also found dchiroins either alone combination insulin increased expression activation insulin receptor substrate irs glucose transporter type glut conclusion work show dchiroins play direct role differentiation function human adipocytes synergizes insulin estrogen recruitment signal transduction pathway involved lipid glucose storage finding give clear insight better understand action dchiroins fat metabolism woman physiology variety disease
52,33859621,Improvement of Insulin Sensitivity Increases Pregnancy Rate in Infertile PCOS Women: A Systemic Review.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infertility in reproductive-age women. Insulin increases steroidogenesis, deranges granulosa cell differentiation, and affects follicle growth. However, results from randomized control trials (RCTs) were heterogeneous, and little strong evidence associated actual achievement of insulin sensitivity (IS) improvement with reproductive outcomes.
To identify evidence of the reproductive benefit of IS improvement in infertile PCOS women by analyzing eligible RCTs.
Different search strategies with unlimited keywords, including treatment, therapy, intervention, polycystic ovary syndrome/PCOS, insulin resistance, pregnancy, conceive, live birth, and randomized controlled trials/RCT were used in databases including Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science to November 20th, 2021.
Two authors independently abstracted study details and assessed study quality.
Ten RCTs that covered different races and met the inclusion criteria were included for analysis and discussion. Clinical pregnancy rate was increased in infertile PCOS women when they had significant improvement of IS after treatment regardless of the various interventions (non-surgical). The benefits of IS improvement appeared superior in PCOS women without severe obesity. The effect of IS improvement on pregnancy rate was independent of the change of BMI.
Nonsurgical therapeutic strategies that promote superior IS improvement may aid infertile PCOS women to increase their possibility of successful pregnancy regardless of the various interventions. The improvement of IS might be more important than the reduction of BMI in the improvement of pregnancy rate in infertile PCOS women.",obesity,improvement insulin sensitivity increase pregnancy rate infertile pcos woman systemic review,polycystic ovary syndrome pcos common cause infertility reproductiveage woman insulin increase steroidogenesis deranges granulosa cell differentiation affect follicle growth however result randomized control trial rcts heterogeneous little strong evidence associated actual achievement insulin sensitivity improvement reproductive outcome identify evidence reproductive benefit improvement infertile pcos woman analyzing eligible rcts different search strategy unlimited keywords including treatment therapy intervention polycystic ovary syndromepcos insulin resistance pregnancy conceive live birth randomized controlled trialsrct used database including pubmed embase web science november th two author independently abstracted study detail assessed study quality ten rcts covered different race met inclusion criterion included analysis discussion clinical pregnancy rate increased infertile pcos woman significant improvement treatment regardless various intervention nonsurgical benefit improvement appeared superior pcos woman without severe obesity effect improvement pregnancy rate independent change bmi nonsurgical therapeutic strategy promote superior improvement may aid infertile pcos woman increase possibility successful pregnancy regardless various intervention improvement might important reduction bmi improvement pregnancy rate infertile pcos woman
53,33859620,Platelet Protein-Related Abnormalities in Response to Acute Hypoglycemia in Type 2 Diabetes.,"Patients with severe COVID-19 infections have coagulation abnormalities indicative of a hypercoagulable state, with thromboembolic complications and increased mortality. Platelets are recognized as mediators of inflammation, releasing proinflammatory and prothrombotic factors, and are hyperactivated in COVID-19 infected patients. Activated platelets have also been reported in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, putting these patients at higher risk for thromboembolic complications of COVID-19 infection.
A case-control study of T2D (n=33) and control subjects (n=30) who underwent a hyperinsulinemic clamp to induce normoglycemia in T2D subjects: T2D: baseline glucose 7.5 ± 0.3mmol/l (135.1 ± 5.4mg/dl), reduced to 4.5 ± 0.07mmol/l (81 ± 1.2mg/dl) with 1-hour clamp; Controls: maintained at 5.1 ± 0.1mmol/l (91.9 ± 1.8mg/dl). Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement was used to determine a panel of platelet proteins.
Prothrombotic platelet proteins were elevated in T2D versus controls: platelet factor 4 (PF4, p<0.05); platelet glycoprotein VI (PGVI p<0.05); P-selectin (p<0.01) and plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1, p<0.01). In addition, the antithrombotic platelet-related proteins, plasmin (p<0.05) and heparin cofactor II (HCFII, p<0.05), were increased in T2D. Normalization of glucose in the T2D cohort had no effect on platelet protein levels.
T2D patients have platelet hyperactivation, placing them at higher risk for thromboembolic events. When infected with COVID-19, this risk may be compounded, and their propensity for a more severe COVID-19 disease course increased.

54,33859538,Glutamine Administration Attenuates Kidney Inflammation in Obese Mice Complicated with Polymicrobial Sepsis.,"Obesity is a well-known public health issue around the world. Sepsis is a lethal clinical syndrome that causes multiorgan failure. Obesity may aggravate inflammation in septic patients. Glutamine (GLN) is a nutrient with immune regulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Since sepsis is a common contributing factor for acute kidney injury (AKI), this study investigated the effects of GLN administration on sepsis-induced inflammation and AKI in obese mice. A high-fat diet which consists of 60% of calories from fat was provided for 10 weeks to induce obesity in the mice. Then, the obese mice were subdivided into sepsis with saline (SS) or GLN (SG) groups. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was performed to produce sepsis. The SS group was intravenously injected with saline while the SG group was administered GLN one or two doses after CLP. Obese mice with sepsis were sacrificed at 12, 24, or 48 h post-CLP. Results revealed that sepsis resulted in upregulated high-mobility group box protein-1 pathway-associated gene expression in obese mice. Also, expressions of macrophage/neutrophil infiltration markers and inflammatory cytokines in kidneys were elevated. Obese mice treated with GLN after sepsis reversed the depletion of plasma GLN, reduced production of lipid peroxides, and downregulated macrophage/neutrophil infiltration and the inflammatory-associated pathway whereas tight junction gene expression increased in the kidneys. These findings suggest that intravenously administered GLN to obese mice after sepsis alleviated inflammation and attenuated AKI.

55,33859487,Incidence and Survival of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Type 2 Diabetes Patients with Cirrhosis Who Were Treated with and without Metformin.,"To evaluate metformin's benefit on the incidence and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.
We conducted a retrospective study from 2006 to 2019. The patients were assigned to metformin exposure if they administered metformin at least 3 months after diagnosis of cirrhosis. The outcomes were incidence and survival of HCC in T2DM with cirrhosis treated with metformin compared with those who were not treated with metformin. For the incidence of HCC, the follow-up time was 5 years after cirrhosis was diagnosed. For the survival of HCC, we censored for vital status in June 2019.
Of 1061 patients, the patients were divided into 719 patients with metformin exposure and 342 in metformin non-exposure. In metformin exposure, 125 patients (17.4%) developed HCC. In metformin non-exposure, 128 patients (37.4%) developed HCC. Metformin exposure had a significantly lower risk of developing HCC in multivariate analysis HR 0.48 (0.36-0.61); P<0.001. For the survival of HCC, 327 patients were recruited. One-hundred and sixty-two patients were in metformin exposure and 165 patients were in metformin non-exposure. Sixty patients (37%) in metformin exposure died, while 84 patients (50.9%) in metformin non-exposure died. The median survival of metformin exposure and metformin non-exposure were 6.9 years and 3.88 years, respectively; P=0.003. In univariate analysis, the metformin exposure was significantly associated with better survival than in the non-exposure group, HR 0.63 (0.45-0.88); P=0.006. No significant difference was observed in multivariate analysis between two groups, HR 1.07 (0.74-1.54); P=0.72.

58,33859430,Inhibition of the IL-17A axis in adipocytes suppresses diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders in mice.,"Overnutrition causes obesity, a global health problem without any effective therapy. Obesity is characterized by low-grade inflammation, which predisposes individuals to metabolic syndrome via unknown mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that abolishing the interleukin-17A (IL-17A) axis in mice by inhibition of RORγt-mediated IL-17A production by digoxin, or by ubiquitous deletion of IL-17 receptor A (Il17ra), suppresses diet-induced obesity (DIO) and metabolic disorders, and promotes adipose-tissue browning, thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Genetic ablation of Il17ra specifically in adipocytes is sufficient to completely prevent DIO and metabolic dysfunction in mice. IL-17A produced in response to DIO induces PPARγ phosphorylation at Ser273 in adipocytes in a CDK5-dependent manner, thereby modifying expression of diabetogenic and obesity genes, which correlates with IL-17A signalling in white adipose tissues of individuals with morbid obesity. These findings reveal an unanticipated role for IL-17A in adipocyte biology, in which its direct action pathogenically reprograms adipocytes, promoting DIO and metabolic syndrome. Targeting the IL-17A axis could be an efficient antiobesity strategy.",obesity,inhibition ila axis adipocytes suppresses dietinduced obesity metabolic disorder mouse,overnutrition cause obesity global health problem without effective therapy obesity characterized lowgrade inflammation predisposes individual metabolic syndrome via unknown mechanism demonstrate abolishing interleukina ila axis mouse inhibition rorγtmediated ila production digoxin ubiquitous deletion il receptor ilra suppresses dietinduced obesity dio metabolic disorder promotes adiposetissue browning thermogenesis energy expenditure genetic ablation ilra specifically adipocytes sufficient completely prevent dio metabolic dysfunction mouse ila produced response dio induces pparγ phosphorylation ser adipocytes cdkdependent manner thereby modifying expression diabetogenic obesity gene correlate ila signalling white adipose tissue individual morbid obesity finding reveal unanticipated role ila adipocyte biology direct action pathogenically reprograms adipocytes promoting dio metabolic syndrome targeting ila axis could efficient antiobesity strategy
59,33859429,Irx3 and Irx5 in Ins2-Cre,"Obesity is mainly due to excessive food intake. IRX3 and IRX5 have been suggested as determinants of obesity in connection with the intronic variants of FTO, but how these genes contribute to obesity via changes in food intake remains unclear. Here, we show that mice doubly heterozygous for Irx3 and Irx5 mutations exhibit lower food intake with enhanced hypothalamic leptin response. By lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing using the Ins2-Cre system, we identify a previously unreported radial glia-like neural stem cell population with high Irx3 and Irx5 expression in early postnatal hypothalamus and demonstrate that reduced dosage of Irx3 and Irx5 promotes neurogenesis in postnatal hypothalamus leading to elevated numbers of leptin-sensing arcuate neurons. Furthermore, we find that mice with deletion of Irx3 in these cells also exhibit a similar food intake and hypothalamic phenotype. Our results illustrate that Irx3 and Irx5 play a regulatory role in hypothalamic postnatal neurogenesis and leptin response.",obesity,irx irx inscre,obesity mainly due excessive food intake irx irx suggested determinant obesity connection intronic variant fto gene contribute obesity via change food intake remains unclear show mouse doubly heterozygous irx irx mutation exhibit lower food intake enhanced hypothalamic leptin response lineage tracing singlecell rna sequencing using inscre system identify previously unreported radial glialike neural stem cell population high irx irx expression early postnatal hypothalamus demonstrate reduced dosage irx irx promotes neurogenesis postnatal hypothalamus leading elevated number leptinsensing arcuate neuron furthermore find mouse deletion irx cell also exhibit similar food intake hypothalamic phenotype result illustrate irx irx play regulatory role hypothalamic postnatal neurogenesis leptin response
60,33859314,Extra virgin olive oil improved body weight and insulin sensitivity in high fat diet-induced obese LDLr-/-.Leiden mice without attenuation of steatohepatitis.,"Dietary fatty acids play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is associated with insulin resistance (IR). Fatty acid composition is critical for IR and subsequent NAFLD development. Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) is the main source of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in Mediterranean diets. This study examined whether EVOO-containing high fat diets may prevent diet-induced NAFLD using Ldlr-/-. Leiden mice. In female Ldlr-/-.Leiden mice, the effects of the following high fat diets (HFDs) were examined: a lard-based HFD (HFD-L); an EVOO-based HFD (HFD-EVOO); a phenolic compounds-rich EVOO HFD (HFD-OL). We studied changes in body weight (BW), lipid profile, transaminases, glucose homeostasis, liver pathology and transcriptome. Both EVOO diets reduced body weight (BW) and improved insulin sensitivity. The EVOOs did not improve transaminase values and increased LDL-cholesterol and liver collagen content. EVOOs and HFD-L groups had comparable liver steatosis. The profibrotic effects were substantiated by an up-regulation of gene transcripts related to glutathione metabolism, chemokine signaling and NF-kappa-B activation and down-regulation of genes relevant for fatty acid metabolism. Collectivelly, EVOO intake improved weight gain and insulin sensitivity but not liver inflammation and fibrosis, which was supported by changes in hepatic genes expression.",obesity,extra virgin olive oil improved body weight insulin sensitivity high fat dietinduced obese ldlrleiden mouse without attenuation steatohepatitis,dietary fatty acid play role pathogenesis obesityassociated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld associated insulin resistance ir fatty acid composition critical ir subsequent nafld development extravirgin olive oil evoo main source monounsaturated fatty acid mufa mediterranean diet study examined whether evoocontaining high fat diet may prevent dietinduced nafld using ldlr leiden mouse female ldlrleiden mouse effect following high fat diet hfds examined lardbased hfd hfdl evoobased hfd hfdevoo phenolic compoundsrich evoo hfd hfdol studied change body weight bw lipid profile transaminase glucose homeostasis liver pathology transcriptome evoo diet reduced body weight bw improved insulin sensitivity evoos improve transaminase value increased ldlcholesterol liver collagen content evoos hfdl group comparable liver steatosis profibrotic effect substantiated upregulation gene transcript related glutathione metabolism chemokine signaling nfkappab activation downregulation gene relevant fatty acid metabolism collectivelly evoo intake improved weight gain insulin sensitivity liver inflammation fibrosis supported change hepatic gene expression
61,33859286,Exendin-4 improves long-term potentiation and neuronal dendritic growth in vivo and in vitro obesity condition.,"Metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes has emerged as a significant issue worldwide. Recent studies have highlighted the relationship between metabolic imbalance and neurological pathologies such as memory loss. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secreted from gut L-cells and specific brain nuclei plays multiple roles including regulation of insulin sensitivity, inflammation and synaptic plasticity. Although GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to have neuroprotective function, the specific mechanism of their action in brain remains unclear. We investigated whether exendin-4, as a GLP-1RA, improves cognitive function and brain insulin resistance in metabolic-imbalanced mice fed a high-fat diet. Considering the result of electrophysiological experiments, exendin-4 inhibits the reduction of long term potentiation (LTP) in high fat diet mouse brain. Further, we identified the neuroprotective effect of exendin-4 in primary cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons in in vitro metabolic imbalanced condition. Our results showed the improvement of IRS-1 phosphorylation, neuronal complexity, and the mature of dendritic spine shape by exendin-4 treatment in metabolic imbalanced in vitro condition. Here, we provides significant evidences on the effect of exendin-4 on synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation, and neural structure.

62,33859285,Predicting anthropometric and metabolic traits with a genetic risk score for obesity in a sample of Pakistanis.,"Obesity is an outcome of multiple factors including environmental and genetic influences. Common obesity is a polygenic trait indicating that multiple genetic variants act synergistically to influence its expression. We constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) based on five genetic variants (MC4R rs17782313, BDNF rs6265, FTO rs1421085, TMEM18 rs7561317, and NEGR1 rs2815752) and examined its association with obesity-related traits in a sample of Pakistanis. The study involved 306 overweight/obese (OW/OB) and 300 normal-weight (NW) individuals. The age range of the study participants was 12-63 years. All anthropometric and metabolic parameters were measured for each participant via standard procedures and biochemical assays, respectively. The genetic variants were genotyped by allelic discrimination assays. The age- and gender-adjusted associations between the GRS and obesity-related anthropometric and metabolic measures were determined using linear regression analyses.

64,33859189,Single cell regulatory landscape of the mouse kidney highlights cellular differentiation programs and disease targets.,"Determining the epigenetic program that generates unique cell types in the kidney is critical for understanding cell-type heterogeneity during tissue homeostasis and injury response. Here, we profile open chromatin and gene expression in developing and adult mouse kidneys at single cell resolution. We show critical reliance of gene expression on distal regulatory elements (enhancers). We reveal key cell type-specific transcription factors and major gene-regulatory circuits for kidney cells. Dynamic chromatin and expression changes during nephron progenitor differentiation demonstrates that podocyte commitment occurs early and is associated with sustained Foxl1 expression. Renal tubule cells follow a more complex differentiation, where Hfn4a is associated with proximal and Tfap2b with distal fate. Mapping single nucleotide variants associated with human kidney disease implicates critical cell types, developmental stages, genes, and regulatory mechanisms.

65,33859154,Complete Laparoscopic Removal and Staging of a Large Ovarian Malignancy: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Advances in minimally invasive surgery are essential for the improvement of patient care, overall health care efficiency, and total cost reductions. Morcellation, the technique used in the present case, is often used to aid minimally invasive laparoscopic procedures, whereby larger tissue specimens are broken down and divided to be removed via smaller incisions. Morcellation has become controversial in the medical community owing to the risk of the procedure spreading an occult malignancy. CASE REPORT A 47-year-old woman with obesity presented with right-sided pelvic pain and suspicion of ovarian torsion. The patient experienced severe acute pain and was taken to the operating room for laparoscopy to remove the left-sided adnexal mass seen on imaging. During surgery, there was no evidence of torsion, and the mass was perfused. During removal of the entire tumor, blunt instruments were utilized for in-bag manual morcellation to avoid spillage of the contents of the bag, which were then sent for frozen section analysis, and a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the ovary was made. Once the tumor was removed, a board-certified gynecologic oncologist was consulted to assist with the remainder of the procedure. Following this, the ovarian cancer staging procedure was able to be completed laparoscopically. CONCLUSIONS This technique of in-bag manual morcellation using blunt instruments allows laparoscopic procedures to be performed on large tissue specimens with potential malignancies without spreading cancerous tissue, overcoming the associated risks of dissemination of malignancy. This technique is therefore more beneficial to patients.",obesity,complete laparoscopic removal staging large ovarian malignancy case report,background advance minimally invasive surgery essential improvement patient care overall health care efficiency total cost reduction morcellation technique used present case often used aid minimally invasive laparoscopic procedure whereby larger tissue specimen broken divided removed via smaller incision morcellation become controversial medical community owing risk procedure spreading occult malignancy case report yearold woman obesity presented rightsided pelvic pain suspicion ovarian torsion patient experienced severe acute pain taken operating room laparoscopy remove leftsided adnexal mass seen imaging surgery evidence torsion mass perfused removal entire tumor blunt instrument utilized inbag manual morcellation avoid spillage content bag sent frozen section analysis diagnosis adenocarcinoma ovary made tumor removed boardcertified gynecologic oncologist consulted assist remainder procedure following ovarian cancer staging procedure able completed laparoscopically conclusion technique inbag manual morcellation using blunt instrument allows laparoscopic procedure performed large tissue specimen potential malignancy without spreading cancerous tissue overcoming associated risk dissemination malignancy technique therefore beneficial patient

This information may be translated into the implementation of personalized nutrition approaches involving precision nutrigenetic and nutrigenomic strategies for obesity monitoring and weight management.
The importance and influence of several nongenetic contributors to obesity onset and individual responses to weight-loss interventions have been highlighted including the role of age, sex or perinatal feeding and others related to an individual's lifestyle and modifiable. Nutrigenetic studies have analysed potential interactions between polymorphisms influencing energy homeostasis/body composition and dietary factors in relation to adiposity phenotypes and therapy responsiveness. A second approach comprises the Nutrigenomic analysis of gene expression modifications in response to the consumption of specific nutrients or dietary bioactive compounds, which may involve epigenetic mechanisms including deoxyribonucleic acid methylation and micro-ribonucleic acid expression profiles.

67,33859104,Optimal inflammatory bowel disease management during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.,"This review aims to summarize the current evidence regarding the risks and implications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and discuss optimal management of IBD during this pandemic.
Patients with IBD are not at increased risk of COVID-19 but several risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) have been identified, such as active IBD, obesity, and corticosteroid use. COVID-19 outcomes are similar among patients with IBD and the overall population. Although biologics have not been shown to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 complications, several risk factors have been associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD, including older age, obesity, the presence of comorbidities, active disease, and corticosteroid use. IBD therapy should, therefore, be continued with the aim of attaining or maintaining remission, except for corticosteroids, which should be held or reduced to the minimal effective dose. Although it has been recommended that immunosuppressive therapy be held during a case of COVID-19, the half-lives of these drugs and data on the timing of restarting therapy limit the strength of these recommendations. We recommend COVID-19 vaccination for IBD patients whenever available, as benefits to the individual and to society outweigh the risks.
As our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 continues to evolve, we are learning more about its impact in patients with IBD and how to better manage patients in this setting. Managing IBD during this pandemic has also highlighted the importance of restructuring services in order to adapt to current and potential future outbreaks.

68,33859102,Impact of bariatric surgery on gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal motility.,"Obesity is rapidly increasing in prevalence, and bariatric surgery has become a popular treatment option that can improve all-cause mortality in obese individuals. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophageal motility disorders are common in the obese population, and the effects of bariatric surgery on these conditions differ depending on the type of bariatric surgery performed.
Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has declined in popularity due to its contributions to worsening GERD symptoms and the development of esophageal dysmotility. Although laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is the most popular type of bariatric surgery, a comprehensive assessment for acid reflux should be performed as LSG has been linked with worsening GERD. Novel methods to address GERD due to LSG include magnetic sphincter augmentation and concomitant fundoplication. Due to the decreased incidence of postoperative GERD and dysmotility compared to other types of bariatric surgeries, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass should be considered for obese patients with GERD and esophageal dysmotility.
Bariatric surgery can affect esophageal motility and contribute to worsening or development of GERD. A thorough workup of gastrointestinal symptoms before bariatric surgery should be performed with consideration for formal testing with high-resolution manometry and pH testing. Based on these results, the choice of bariatric surgery technique should be tailored accordingly to improve clinical outcomes.",obesity,impact bariatric surgery gastroesophageal reflux disease esophageal motility,obesity rapidly increasing prevalence bariatric surgery become popular treatment option improve allcause mortality obese individual gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd esophageal motility disorder common obese population effect bariatric surgery condition differ depending type bariatric surgery performed laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding declined popularity due contribution worsening gerd symptom development esophageal dysmotility although laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy lsg popular type bariatric surgery comprehensive assessment acid reflux performed lsg linked worsening gerd novel method address gerd due lsg include magnetic sphincter augmentation concomitant fundoplication due decreased incidence postoperative gerd dysmotility compared type bariatric surgery rouxeny gastric bypass considered obese patient gerd esophageal dysmotility bariatric surgery affect esophageal motility contribute worsening development gerd thorough workup gastrointestinal symptom bariatric surgery performed consideration formal testing highresolution manometry ph testing based result choice bariatric surgery technique tailored accordingly improve clinical outcome
69,33859058,Morin alleviates fructose-induced metabolic syndrome in rats ,"Metabolic syndrome (MBS) is a widespread disease that has strongly related to unhealthy diet and low physical activity, which initiate more serious conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to examine the therapeutic effects of morin, as one of the flavonoids constituents, which widely exists in many herbs and fruits, against some metabolic and hepatic manifestations observed in MBS rats and the feasible related mechanisms. MBS was induced in rats by high fructose diet feeding for 12 weeks. Morin (30 mg/ kg) was administered orally to both normal and MBS rats for 4 weeks. Liver tissues were used for determination of liver index, hepatic expression of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) as well as both inflammatory and fibrotic markers. The fat/muscle ratio, metabolic parameters, systolic blood pressure, and oxidative stress markers were also determined. Our data confirmed that the administration of morin in fructose diet rats significantly reduced the elevated systolic blood pressure. The altered levels of metabolic parameters such as blood glucose, serum insulin, serum lipid profile, and oxidative stress markers were also reversed approximately to the normal values. In addition, morin treatment decreased liver index, serum liver enzyme activities, and fat/muscle ratio. Furthermore, morin relatively up-regulated GLUT2 expression, however, down-regulated NF-κB, TNF-α, and TGF-β expressions in the hepatic tissues. Here, we revealed that morin has an exquisite effect against metabolic disorders in the experimental model through, at least in part, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic mechanisms.",obesity,morin alleviates fructoseinduced metabolic syndrome rat,metabolic syndrome mb widespread disease strongly related unhealthy diet low physical activity initiate serious condition obesity cardiovascular disease type diabetes mellitus study aimed examine therapeutic effect morin one flavonoid constituent widely exists many herb fruit metabolic hepatic manifestation observed mb rat feasible related mechanism mb induced rat high fructose diet feeding week morin mg kg administered orally normal mb rat week liver tissue used determination liver index hepatic expression glucose transporter glut well inflammatory fibrotic marker fatmuscle ratio metabolic parameter systolic blood pressure oxidative stress marker also determined data confirmed administration morin fructose diet rat significantly reduced elevated systolic blood pressure altered level metabolic parameter blood glucose serum insulin serum lipid profile oxidative stress marker also reversed approximately normal value addition morin treatment decreased liver index serum liver enzyme activity fatmuscle ratio furthermore morin relatively upregulated glut expression however downregulated nfκb tnfα tgfβ expression hepatic tissue revealed morin exquisite effect metabolic disorder experimental model least part antioxidant antiinflammatory antifibrotic mechanism

The association of these immune responses with macro- and microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes remains unclarified. We investigated associations between MGO-modified apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) and apoB100 peptide 5 (MGO-p5) autoantibodies and coronary atherosclerosis and retinopathy in type 1 diabetes.
IgM and IgG against MGO-apoB100 and MGO-p5 were measured by ELISA in plasma from 103 subjects with type 1 diabetes and 63 control subjects (Dialong study) and in a replication cohort of 27 subjects with type 1 diabetes (Oslo study). Coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by computed tomography coronary angiography or intravascular ultrasound. Retinopathy was classified by retinal photos.

73,33858854,"Diabetes and Overweight/Obesity Are Independent, Nonadditive Risk Factors for In-Hospital Severity of COVID-19: An International, Multicenter Retrospective Meta-analysis.","Obesity is an established risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the contribution of overweight and/or diabetes remains unclear. In a multicenter, international study, we investigated if overweight, obesity, and diabetes were independently associated with COVID-19 severity and whether the BMI-associated risk was increased among those with diabetes.
We retrospectively extracted data from health care records and regional databases of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 from 18 sites in 11 countries. We used standardized definitions and analyses to generate site-specific estimates, modeling the odds of each outcome (supplemental oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support, invasive mechanical ventilatory support, and in-hospital mortality) by BMI category (reference, overweight, obese), adjusting for age, sex, and prespecified comorbidities. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with preexisting diabetes. Site-specific estimates were combined in a meta-analysis.
Among 7,244 patients (65.6% overweight/obese), those with overweight were more likely to require oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support (random effects adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44; 95% CI 1.15-1.80) and invasive mechanical ventilatory support (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.03-1.46). There was no association between overweight and in-hospital mortality (aOR, 0.88; 95% CI 0.74-1.04). Similar effects were observed in patients with obesity or diabetes. In the subgroup analysis, the aOR for any outcome was not additionally increased in those with diabetes and overweight or obesity.

This study 1) examined whether stress and depressive symptoms are associated with diet quality (via Healthy Eating Index [HEI] 2015 total scores and dietary intake of food groups/nutrients that align with HEI-2015 components) and 2) tested race as a moderator in the relationship between mental health and diet quality.
This was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a randomized controlled trial collected January 2015 through January 2019 in Columbia, South Carolina. Trained staff administered demographic and psychosocial questionnaires and conducted anthropometric measures. Participants completed two 24-hour dietary recalls, which were self-administered (one on-site, one at home).
The Health in Pregnancy and Postpartum study was a randomized controlled trial targeting excessive gestational weight gain among pregnant women with overweight/obesity (N = 228).
The HEI-2015 total scores and food groups/nutrients that align with HEI-2015 were calculated.
Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate the relationship between mental health and HEI-2015 total scores and dietary intake of food groups or nutrients that align with HEI-2015 components. Multiplicative interaction terms of stress or depressive symptoms with race were used to determine moderation.
Participants' diet quality was suboptimal (M = 52.0 ± 11.7; range, 27-85). Stress was negatively associated with HEI-2015 total scores (crude but not adjusted model). Stress scores were positively associated with consumption of dairy, refined grains, and added sugars and negatively associated with total protein foods. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with consumption of dairy, refined grains, and saturated fats. Race was not a moderator.

81,33858407,The challenges of becoming and being a clinician manager: a qualitative exploration of the perception of medical doctors in senior leadership roles at a large Australian health service.,"In Australia, activity-based funding models have emphasized the need for hospitals to be accountable for their clinical performance. Clinician managers, with medical backgrounds are essential to ensuring high quality clinical performance and operational management of hospital services. The purpose of this study is to 1. Identify factors influencing doctors to become clinician managers in the Australian healthcare setting. 2. Understand the pathways and challenges faced by doctors in becoming clinician managers.
We undertook a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews of 18 clinician managers (who have medical practitioner backgrounds) with formal leadership administrative roles. Interview transcripts were analysed with systematic text condensation.
All eligible participants approached in this context, agreed to participate and over 80% of the participants were male. We identified five themes: 'Motivations for leadership', 'Pathways to managerial role', 'Challenges faced in management roles', 'Credibility through clinical practice' and 'Management skill cultivation and support'. Clinician managers progressed from being doctors to leadership roles through being encouraged to take on roles, while others felt pressure to take on leadership roles even if this was not a personal goal. Clinician managers described challenges such as feeling under-prepared, maintaining respect form colleagues through still participating in a clinical load, along with juggling priorities such as administrative tasks, managing budgets and performance managing other doctors.
There needs to be an intentional and more structured approach to training and supporting clinician managers that considers the complex challenges faced by individuals (especially women) as they progress into these roles in the Australian tertiary health services context. There is a need to consider ways of supporting clinician managers to focus on management skills, effective mentorship and address perceptions around losing respect from colleagues if clinician managers cease their clinical loads. Further research is needed among the female medical workforce, along with research to understand if maintaining clinical loads when undertaking a clinical management role in fact leads to better effectiveness in contributing to better patient safety and quality outcomes.

82,33858402,Association between alcohol consumption status and obesity-related comorbidities in men: data from the 2016 Korean community health survey.,"This study was performed to investigate the association between the amount of alcohol consumption or binge drinking and obesity-related comorbidities in Korean men.
A total of 103,048 men aged 19 years or older were investigated in the 2016 Korean Community Health Survey. The participants were divided into five groups according to the standard number of alcoholic drinks consumed per week.
Of the total participants, 20.7% were in the high alcohol consumption group, consuming more than 28 drinks per week. After adjustment for clinical factors, high alcohol consumption was significantly associated with higher odds ratios (ORs) of obesity (OR, 1.449; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.412 to 1.591; P < 0.0001), hypertension (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.636 to 1.894; P < 0.0001), and dyslipidemia (OR, 1.356; 95% CI, 1.247 to 1.474; P < 0.0001). In contrast, mild to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a lower risk of diabetes (OR, 0.799; 95% CI, 0.726 to 0.88; P = 0.0015) and high alcohol consumption was not associated with a higher risk of diabetes (OR, 0.945; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.039; P = 0.0662). Among drinkers, except for social drinkers, binge drinking was significantly associated with higher risks of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.
High alcohol consumption was associated with higher risks of obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in Korean men. In contrast, high consumption was not associated with a higher risk of diabetes.

Maintaining the optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level is crucial for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We investigated whether muscle mass was associated with dyslipidemia.
We analyzed the data of 17,546 adults from the 2008-2011 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) and 5126 adults from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). Participants were classified into the lower skeletal muscle mass index (LSMI) group and normal group. LSMI was defined as body mass index (BMI)-adjusted appendicular skeletal muscle mass <0.789 (men) and <0.512 (women) in the KNHANES, and as sex-specific lowest quintile of the BMI-adjusted total skeletal muscle mass in the KoGES. Participants were defined as having dyslipidemia when the serum LDL cholesterol levels were higher than their LDL cholesterol management targets based on their CVD risk level.
The odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dyslipidemia of the LSMI group was 1.230 (1.016-1.488, p = 0.034) after adjusting for confounding variables compared to the normal group in the 2008-2011 KNHANES. In the KoGES, the hazard ratio with 95% CI for incident dyslipidemia of the LSMI group compared to the normal group was 1.225 (1.101-1.364, p < 0.001).

This study was to investigate the effects and mechanism by which walnut green husk polysaccharides (WGHP) prevents obesity, oxidative stress, inflammation, liver and colon damage in HF diet induced rats. We found that WGHP alleviated HF-induced abnormal weight gain, disordered lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, colonic tissue injury and up-regulate the expression level of colonic tight junction protein in the rats. Besides, the administration of WGHP promoted browning of iWAT and thermogenesis in BAT of HF-fed rats, and improved gut microbiota dysbiosis by increasing the bacterial diversity and reducing the relative abundance of potential pathogenic bacteria in the colon of the rats. Furthermore, WGHP consumption not only increased the SCFAs content but also improved the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae and Allobaculum in the gut of rats.

This study examines the influence of negative childhood experiences on body mass index (BMI) and obesity (BMI ≥30) during older adulthood and the psychosocial and behavioral pathways involved. Using a nationally representative sample, we examine the influence of cumulative misfortune as well as five separate domains of misfortune on BMI and obesity. Results show that four of the five domains are associated with BMI and obesity either directly, indirectly, or both.

94,33856831,Delay discounting and obesity in food insecure and food secure women.,"The relation between food insecurity (FI) and delay discounting (DD) and probability discounting (PD) for food and money was tested in women. In addition, discounting was tested as a variable that mediates the relation between obesity and FI.
Women recruited from a community sample (N = 92) completed questionnaires. They completed the food choice questionnaire, the monetary choice questionnaire, measures for food and money probability discounting (which quantify sensitivity to risk aversion), and demographic measures.
Women with FI had higher rates of obesity and higher food DD compared to food-secure women. However, DD for money or probability discounting for food or money did not significantly differ between FI and food secure groups when controlling for significant covariates. Neither DD or PD significantly mediated the relation between FI and obesity.
These results suggest that FI is associated with greater impulsive food choice, but its association with other monetary discounting and probability discounting for food and money appears contingent upon other demographic factors.

By using robust mouse models of bariatric surgery that closely resemble those performed in humans, we can compare the effects of RYGB and VSG on adipose physiology in the absence of post-operative confounds such as diet and lifestyle changes.
RYGB and VSG were compared using a diet-induced mouse model of obesity. High-fat diet (HFD) was administered post-operatively and changes to white and brown adipose tissue were evaluated, along with alterations to weight, glucose homeostasis, dyslipidemia, and insulin sensitivity.
After prolonged exposure to high-fat diet post-operatively, RYGB was effective in achieving sustained weight loss, while VSG unexpectedly accelerated weight gain rates. The resolution of obesity-related comorbidities such as glucose and insulin intolerance, dyslipidemia, and insulin sensitivity was improved after RYGB, but not for VSG. In RYGB, there were improvements to the function and health of white adipose tissue, enhanced brown adipose metabolism, and the browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue, with no comparable changes seen for these factors after VSG. Some markers of systemic inflammation improved after both RYGB and VSG.

99,33856499,American College of Cardiology Body Mass Index Counseling Quality Improvement Initiative.,"Overweight/obesity, prevalent cardiovascular risk factors in children, can be associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in children with heart disease. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) developed quality metrics including a BMI metric related to identifying and counseling overweight and obese children presenting to cardiology clinics. This metric was used for a multicenter collaborative learning Quality improvement (QI) Project through the ACC Quality Network (QNet). Our aim was to increase the percentage of children between ages 3 and 18 years presenting to cardiology clinics at participating centers with BMI > 85th percentile who received appropriate counseling. Participating centers submitted data quarterly to QNet for a sample of patients who received counseling. A Key Driver Diagram was created to help teams drive improvement. Individual centers customized interventions and participated in network-wide educational learning sessions about QI and shared experience. Statistical process control charts were used. From 04/01/2017 to 09/30/2019, 27,511 patient visits were included. Among 32 participating centers, overall counseling rate was 54%. The BMI counseling rate increased from 25% in 2017Q2 to 54% in 2019Q3. There was a wide variation from 10 to 100% in the performance of individual centers.

0,33862674,The Relationship Between Amount of Extra-prostatic Extension and Length of Capsular Contact: Performances from MR Images and Radical Prostatectomy Specimens.,"In prostate cancer, extraprostatic extension (EPE) is an unfavorable prognostic factor and the grade of EPE is correlated with the prognosis. This study aims to evaluate the utility of length of capsular contact (LCC ) in predicting the grade of EPE by correlating the measurements from MRI images and the measurements performed from radical prostatectomy specimens.
MR images and specimens of 110 tumors are analyzed retrospectively. The specimens are used as reference to validate the presence of EPE and to measure the ground truth LCC. MR images are evaluated by two radiologists to identify the presence of EPE and to predict the LCC indirectly. Reliability, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the evaluations are analyzed in comparison with the findings obtained from the specimens.
In detection of EPE existence, the radiologists achieve almost the same performance (all AUCs= 0.73) with optimal cut-off values lead to moderate sensitivity and specificity pairs (For cut-off= 15.8 mm; Se= 0.69, Sp= 0.68 and for cut-off of 14.5 mm: Se= 0.77, Sp= 0.62). In distinguishing high-grade EPE from low-grade EPE, the radiologists accomplish very similar performances (AUCs= 0.73 and 0.72) Optimal thresholds of 20.0 mm and 18.5 mm for the readers retrospectively reveal medium sensitivity and specificity pairs (Se= 0.64, Sp= 0.67; Se = 0.64, Sp = 0.67).

4,33862649,"[Heidelberg Milestones Communication (HeiMeKOM) - Experiences, Best Practice Examples and Recommendations from the Final Symposium on January 30 and 31 in 2020].","The National Cancer Plan emphasises the importance of medical communication and calls for its integration into medical education and training. In this context, the Milestone Communication Approach meets the communicative challenges in dealing with lung cancer patients. Interprofessional tandems, consisting of doctors and nurses, conduct structured conversations at defined moments with patients and their relatives. The concept aims at shared decision making, continuity in the care of lung cancer patients and the early integration of palliative care. During the symposium on the Heidelberg Milestone Communication in January 2020, recommendations on the care situation of lung cancer patients in advanced stages were developed. In addition, the further adaptability of HeiMeKOM to other settings and hospitals and to other diseases was discussed as well as the possibility of implementing such a concept in standard care. This article presents the experiences, best practice examples and recommendations discussed during the symposium in order to enable their extrapolation to other similarly oriented projects. The long-term goal is to transfer the milestone concept to other hospital, primarily certified lung cancer centers, and to ensure permanent funding. For further dissemination of the concept and, above all, to have it established in standard care, health policy awareness and support are required in addition to the integration of the concept in competence catalogues of continuing medical and nursing education.
Der Nationale Krebsplan hebt die Bedeutung der ärztlichen Kommunikation hervor und fordert deren Integration in die medizinische Aus- und Weiterbildung. In diesem Sinne begegnet das Konzept der Heidelberger Meilenstein Kommunikation den besonderen Herausforderungen im Umgang mit Lungenkrebspatientnnen mit einem interprofessionellen, strukturierten und vorausschauenden Ansatz. Interprofessionelle Tandems, bestehend aus ÄrztInnen und Pflegefachpersonen, führen gemeinsam strukturierte Gespräche zu definierten Zeitpunkten im Erkrankungsverlauf mit LungenkrebspatientInnen und deren Angehörigen durch.

The development of intersegmental plane is the most critical step in segmentectomy. At present, there are many methods to identify the intersegmental plane. Also, dissection of the intersegmental plane has been a challenge for thoracic surgeons for decades because of the complicated anatomic variations.

6,33862622,"A Systematic Review of Minimally Invasive Procedures for Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: Too Minimal, Too Fast?","Cortico-amygdalohippocampectomy (CAH) is effective for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). Concerns regarding surgical morbidity have generated enthusiasm for more minimally invasive interventions. A careful analysis of current data is warranted before widespread adoption of these techniques.
To systematically review the use of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC), and focused ultrasound for mTLE.
Major online databases were searched for prospective observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and retrospective studies (>50 patients), including mTLE patients. Outcomes of interest were seizure freedom (Engel I), complications and re-operation rates, and neuropsychological and quality-of-life (QoL) data.
Nineteen publications were identified. At ≥6 mo postoperatively, LITT (9/19) Engel I outcomes ranged from 52% to 80%. SRS (3/19) has a latency period (52%-67%, 24-36 mo postoperatively) and the radiosurgery vs. open surgery for epilepsy (ROSE) trial reported inferiority of SRS compared to CAH. RF-TC (7/19) demonstrated variable seizure freedom rates (0%-79%) and high re-operation rates (0%-90%). Twelve studies reported neuropsychological outcomes but QoL (4/19) was not widely reported, and few studies (3/19) assessed both. Study quality ranged from fair to good.
Based on nonrandomized data, LITT has compelling evidence of efficacy; however, comparisons to surgical resection are lacking. SRS has a latency period and is inferior to CAH (ROSE trial). RF-TC is a less resource-intensive alternative to LITT; however, comparisons of efficacy are limited.

We are writing on behalf of a multidisciplinary group of academic neuro-oncology professionals who met at the collaborative Christopher Davidson Forum at Washington University in St Louis in the fall of 2019. We propose a dramatic but necessary change to the routine management of patients with GBM to advance the field: to routinely biopsy recurrent GBM at the time of presumed recurrence.

8,33862616,An approach for estimating dosimetric uncertainties in deformable dose accumulation in pencil beam scanning proton therapy for lung cancer.,"Deformable image registration (DIR) is an important component for dose accumulation and associated clinical outcome evaluation in radiotherapy. However, as an ill-posed problem, the resulting deformation vector field (DVF) is subject to unavoidable discrepancies when different algorithms are applied, leading to dosimetric uncertainties of the accumulated dose. We propose here an approach for proton therapy to estimate dosimetric uncertainties as a consequence of modeled or estimated DVF uncertainties.
A patient-specific DVF uncertainty model was built on the first treatment fraction, by correlating the magnitude differences of five DIR results at each voxel to the magnitude of any single reference DIR. In the following fractions, only the reference DIR needs to be applied, and DVF geometric uncertainties were estimated by this model. The associated dosimetric uncertainties were then derived by considering the estimated geometric DVF uncertainty, the dose gradient of fractional recalculated dose distribution and the direction factor from the applied reference DIR of this fraction. This estimated dose uncertainty was respectively compared to the reference dose uncertainty when different DIRs were applied individually for each dose warping. This approach was validated on seven NSCLC patients, each with nine repeated CTs.
The proposed model-based method is able to achieve dose uncertainty distribution on a conservative voxel-to-voxel comparison within ±5% of the prescribed dose to the 'reference' dosimetric uncertainty, for 77% of the voxels in the body and 66-98% of voxels in investigated structures.

9,33862601,Dosimetric analysis of cervical cancer stage IIB patients treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy using plan uncertainty parameters module of Varian Eclipse treatment planning system.,"The present study aims to investigate the dosimetric and radiobiological impact of patient setup errors (PSE) on the target and organs at risk (OAR) of the cervix carcinoma stage IIB patients treated with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) delivery technique using plan uncertainty parameters module of Varian Eclipse treatment planning system and in-house developed DVH Analyzer program.
A total of 976 VMAT plans were generated to simulate the PSE in the base plan that varies from -10 mm to 10 mm in a step size of 1 mm in x- (lateral), y- (craniocaudal), and z- (anteroposterior) directions. The different OAR and tumor volumes were delineated in each case. The various plan quality metric parameters, NTCP and TCP were calculated from the DVH bands generated from the cohort of treatment plans associated with each patient case, using an in-house developed ""DVH Analyzer"" program. The extracted parameters were statistically analyzed and compared with the base plan's dosimetric parameters having no PSE.
The maximum variation of (i) 2.4%, 21.5%, 0.8%, 2.5% in D2cc of bladder, rectum, small bowel and sigmoid colon respectively; (ii) 19.3% and 18.9% in Dmax of the left and right femoral heads (iii) 16.9% in D95% of PTV (iv) 12.1% in NTCP of sigmoid colon were observed with change of PSE in all directions. TCP of PTV was found to be drastically changed beyond 0.4 cm in x+, y+, z+ directions and 0.7 cm in x-, y- and z- directions respectively.
This study presents the effect of PSE on TCP of PTV and NTCP of the OAR for the cervix carcinoma cases treated with VMAT technique and also recommends daily image guidance to mitigate the effects of PSE.

12,33862584,Metabolomic profiling of pancreatic adenocarcinoma reveals key features driving clinical outcome and drug resistance.,"Although significant advances have been made recently to characterize the biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), more efforts are needed to improve our understanding and to face challenges related to the aggressiveness, high mortality rate and chemoresistance of this disease.
In this study, we perform the metabolomics profiling of 77 PDAC patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTX) to investigate the relationship of metabolic profiles with overall survival (OS) in PDAC patients, tumor phenotypes and resistance to five anticancer drugs (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, docetaxel, SN-38 and 5-Fluorouracil).
We identified a metabolic signature that was able to predict the clinical outcome of PDAC patients (p < 0.001, HR=2.68 [95% CI: 1.5-4.9]). The correlation analysis showed that this metabolomic signature was significantly correlated with the PDAC molecular gradient (PAMG) (R = 0.44 and p < 0.001) indicating significant association to the transcriptomic phenotypes of tumors. Resistance score established, based on growth rate inhibition metrics using 35 PDTX-derived primary cells, allowed to identify several metabolites related to drug resistance which was globally accompanied by accumulation of several diacy-phospholipids and decrease in lysophospholipids. Interestingly, targeting glycerophospholipid synthesis improved sensitivity to the three tested cytotoxic drugs indicating that interfering with metabolism could be a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome the challenging resistance of PDAC.
In conclusion, this study shows that the metabolomic profile of pancreatic PDTX models is strongly associated to clinical outcome, transcriptomic phenotypes and drug resistance. We also showed that targeting the lipidomic profile could be used in combinatory therapies against chemoresistance in PDAC.",Cancer,metabolomic profiling pancreatic adenocarcinoma reveals key feature driving clinical outcome drug resistance,although significant advance made recently characterize biology pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac effort needed improve understanding face challenge related aggressiveness high mortality rate chemoresistance disease study perform metabolomics profiling pdac patientderived tumor xenograft pdtx investigate relationship metabolic profile overall survival pdac patient tumor phenotype resistance five anticancer drug gemcitabine oxaliplatin docetaxel sn fluorouracil identified metabolic signature able predict clinical outcome pdac patient p hr ci correlation analysis showed metabolomic signature significantly correlated pdac molecular gradient pamg r p indicating significant association transcriptomic phenotype tumor resistance score established based growth rate inhibition metric using pdtxderived primary cell allowed identify several metabolite related drug resistance globally accompanied accumulation several diacyphospholipids decrease lysophospholipids interestingly targeting glycerophospholipid synthesis improved sensitivity three tested cytotoxic drug indicating interfering metabolism could promising therapeutic strategy overcome challenging resistance pdac conclusion study show metabolomic profile pancreatic pdtx model strongly associated clinical outcome transcriptomic phenotype drug resistance also showed targeting lipidomic profile could used combinatory therapy chemoresistance pdac
13,33862582,A genetically defined signature of responsiveness to erlotinib in early-stage pancreatic cancer patients: Results from the CONKO-005 trial.,"high recurrence rates of up to 75% within 2 years in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients resected for cure indicate a high medical need for clinical prediction tools and patient specific treatment approaches. Addition of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib to adjuvant chemotherapy failed to improve outcome but its efficacy in some patients warrants predictors of responsiveness.
we analysed tumour samples from 293 R0-resected patients from the randomized, multicentre phase III CONKO-005 trial (gemcitabine ± erlotinib) with targeted sequencing, copy number, and RNA expression analyses.
a total of 1086 mutations and 4157 copy-number aberrations (CNAs) with a mean of 17.9 /tumour were identified. Main pathways affected by genetic aberrations were the MAPK-pathway (99%), cell cycle control (92%), TGFβ signalling (77%), chromatin remodelling (71%), and the PI3K/AKT pathway (65%). Based on genetic signatures extracted with non-negative matrix factorization we could define five patient clusters, which differed in mutation patterns, gene expression profiles, and survival. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, SMAD4 aberrations were identified as a negative prognostic marker in the gemcitabine arm, an effect that was counteracted when treated with erlotinib (DFS: HR=1.59, p = 0.016, and OS: HR = 1.67, p = 0.014). Integration of differential gene expression analysis established SMAD4 alterations with low MAPK9 expression (n = 91) as a predictive biomarker for longer DFS (HR=0.49; test for interaction, p = 0.02) and OS (HR = 0.32; test for interaction, p = 0.001).
this study identified five biologically distinct patient clusters with different actionable lesions and unravelled a previously unappreciated association of SMAD4 alteration status with erlotinib effectiveness. Confirmatory studies and mechanistic experiments are warranted to challenge the hypothesis that SMAD4 status might guide addition of erlotinib treatment in early-stage PDAC patients.",Cancer,genetically defined signature responsiveness erlotinib earlystage pancreatic cancer patient result conko trial,high recurrence rate within year pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac patient resected cure indicate high medical need clinical prediction tool patient specific treatment approach addition egfr inhibitor erlotinib adjuvant chemotherapy failed improve outcome efficacy patient warrant predictor responsiveness analysed tumour sample rresected patient randomized multicentre phase iii conko trial gemcitabine erlotinib targeted sequencing copy number rna expression analysis total mutation copynumber aberration cnas mean tumour identified main pathway affected genetic aberration mapkpathway cell cycle control tgfβ signalling chromatin remodelling pikakt pathway based genetic signature extracted nonnegative matrix factorization could define five patient cluster differed mutation pattern gene expression profile survival multivariable cox regression analysis smad aberration identified negative prognostic marker gemcitabine arm effect counteracted treated erlotinib dfs hr p hr p integration differential gene expression analysis established smad alteration low mapk expression n predictive biomarker longer dfs hr test interaction p hr test interaction p study identified five biologically distinct patient cluster different actionable lesion unravelled previously unappreciated association smad alteration status erlotinib effectiveness confirmatory study mechanistic experiment warranted challenge hypothesis smad status might guide addition erlotinib treatment earlystage pdac patient
14,33862578,Assessment of prognostic factors in long-term survival of male and female patients with colorectal cancer using non-mixture cure model based on the Weibull distribution.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is known as one of the malignant form of cells growing in the inner lining of colon and rectum which could seriously affect the cure rate of patients. We aimed to evaluate the effect of prognostic factors on cure fraction of CRC patients.
A total of 1043 CRC patients were included to the study from December 2001 to January 2007 at the Research Center of Gastroenterology and Liver Disease in Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Patients' information was extracted from their medical records, then they were followed to identify their death status via phone-call. Weibull non-mixture cure model was used to evaluate the effect of the risk factors on cure fraction of CRC patients.
The five-years survival rate was 0.66 (males: 0.64 and female: 0.69). The median survival time for non-cured CRC patients were 3.45 years (males: 3.46; females = 3.45 years). In the single Weibull model, BMI≥30 (OR = 4.61, p-value = 0.033), poorly differentiated tumor grade (OR = 0.36, p-value = 0.036), tumor size≥25 mm (OR = 0.22, p-value = 0.046), and N1-stage (OR = 0.42, p-value = 0.005) had significant effect on females' cure fraction. Also, cure fraction of male CRC patients significantly affected by BMI (levels:25.0-29.9-OR = 12.13-p-value<0.001; ≥30-OR = 7.00-p-value = 0.017), T1-stage (OR = 0.52, p-value = 0.021), M1-stage (OR = 0.45, p-value = 0.007), IV-staging (OR = 0.36, p-value = 0.041) and IBD (OR = 0.26, p-value = 0.017). In multiple Weibull model, females were associated with tumor size≥25 mm (OR = 0.20, p-value = 0.044) and N1-stage (OR = 0.45, p-value = 0.013) and males were affected by M1-stage (OR = 0.41, p-value = 0.011) and IBD (OR = 0.20, p-value = 0.022).The cure fraction of males and females CRC patients was 64% and 69%, respectively.

This cross-sectional study was conducted in alive and disease-free patients at least 1 year after total laryngectomy ± partial pharyngectomy. Patients completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core (QLQ-C30) and Head and Neck Cancer (QLQ-H&N35) QoL questionnaires, the Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10) questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The level of dysphagia was evaluated using the Dysphagia Handicap Index (DHI) and the Dysphagia Outcomes and Severity Scale (DOSS). Predictive factors of these clinical outcomes were determined in univariate and multivariate analysis.
A total of 48 patients were included in this study. Long-term QoL and functioning scales scores were all superior to 70%. Main persistent symptoms were fatigue, dyspnea, senses, speech and coughing problems. A DOSS score ≥6, indicating normal/subnormal swallowing function, and a VHI-10 score ≤20, representing light to medium voice disorders, were found in at least 75% of patients. An anxiodepressive disorder (HADS global score ≥ 15) was reported by 15 (31%) patients and represented the main predictor of QoL and voice outcomes. A strong correlation was found between VHI-10 and global QoL scores.

16,33862575,Folate-targeted Pluronic-chitosan nanocapsules loaded with IR780 for near-infrared fluorescence imaging and photothermal-photodynamic therapy of ovarian cancer.,"Herein, we report the fabrication of a nanotherapeutic platform integrating near-infrared (NIR) imaging with combined therapeutic potential through photodynamic (PDT) and photothermal therapies (PTT) and recognition functionality against ovarian cancer. Owing to its NIR fluorescence, singlet oxygen generation and heating capacity, IR780 iodide is exploited to construct a multifunctional nanosystem for single-wavelength NIR laser imaging-assisted dual-modal phototherapy. We opted for loading IR780 into polymeric Pluronic-F127-chitosan nanoformulation in order to overcome its hydrophobicity and toxicity and to allow functionalization with folic acid. The obtained nanocapsules show temperature-dependent swelling and spectroscopic behavior with favorable size distribution for cellular uptake at physiological temperatures, improved fluorescence properties and good stability. The fabricated nanocapsules can efficiently generate singlet oxygen in solution and are able to produce considerable temperature increase (46 °C) upon NIR laser irradiation. Viability assays on NIH-OVCAR-3 cells confirm the successful biocompatibilization of IR780 by encapsulating in Pluronic and chitosan polymers. NIR fluorescence imaging assays reveal the ability of folic-acid functionalized nanocapsules to serve as intracellular contrast agents and demonstrate their active targeting capacity against folate receptor expressing ovarian cancer cells (NIH-OVCAR-3). Consequently, the targeted nanocapsules show improved NIR laser induced phototherapeutic performance against NIH-OVCAR-3 cells compared to free IR780. We anticipate that this class of nanocapsules holds great promise as theranostic agents for application in image-guided dual PDT-PTT and imaging assisted surgery of ovarian cancer.",Cancer,folatetargeted pluronicchitosan nanocapsules loaded ir nearinfrared fluorescence imaging photothermalphotodynamic therapy ovarian cancer,herein report fabrication nanotherapeutic platform integrating nearinfrared nir imaging combined therapeutic potential photodynamic pdt photothermal therapy ptt recognition functionality ovarian cancer owing nir fluorescence singlet oxygen generation heating capacity ir iodide exploited construct multifunctional nanosystem singlewavelength nir laser imagingassisted dualmodal phototherapy opted loading ir polymeric pluronicfchitosan nanoformulation order overcome hydrophobicity toxicity allow functionalization folic acid obtained nanocapsules show temperaturedependent swelling spectroscopic behavior favorable size distribution cellular uptake physiological temperature improved fluorescence property good stability fabricated nanocapsules efficiently generate singlet oxygen solution able produce considerable temperature increase c upon nir laser irradiation viability assay nihovcar cell confirm successful biocompatibilization ir encapsulating pluronic chitosan polymer nir fluorescence imaging assay reveal ability folicacid functionalized nanocapsules serve intracellular contrast agent demonstrate active targeting capacity folate receptor expressing ovarian cancer cell nihovcar consequently targeted nanocapsules show improved nir laser induced phototherapeutic performance nihovcar cell compared free ir anticipate class nanocapsules hold great promise theranostic agent application imageguided dual pdtptt imaging assisted surgery ovarian cancer
17,33862572,Reduction-sensitive polymeric micelles as amplifying oxidative stress vehicles for enhanced antitumor therapy.,"Chemotherapy-photodynamic therapy (PDT)-based combination therapy is a currently frequently used means in cancer treatment that photosensitizer was able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for improving chemotherapy, owing to the high oxidative stress of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Whereas, cancer cells were accustomed to oxidative stress by overexpression of antioxidant such as glutathione (GSH), which would consume the damage of ROS, as well as it could result in ineffective treatment. Herein, amplification of oxidative stress preferentially in tumor cells by consuming GSH or generating ROS is a reasonable treatment strategy to develop anticancer drugs. To achieve excellent therapeutic effects, we designed a GSH-scavenging and ROS-generating polymeric micelle mPEG-S-S-PCL-Por (MSLP) for amplifying oxidative stress and enhanced anticancer therapy. The amphiphilic polymer of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG)-S-S-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)-Protoporphyrin (Por) was self-assembled into polymeric micelles with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) for treatment and tracking via FRET. Spherical DOX/MSLP micelles with the average size of 88.76 ± 3.52 nm was procured with negatively charged surface, reduction sensitivity and high drug loading content (17.47 ± 1.53 %). The intracellular ROS detection showed that the MSLP could deplete glutathione and regenerate additional ROS. The cellular uptake of DOX/MSLP micelles was grabbed real-time monitoring by the Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect between DOX and MSLP. The reduction-sensitive polymeric micelles MSLP as amplifying oxidative stress vehicles combined chemotherapy and PDT exhibited significant antitumor activity both in vitro (IC50 = 0.041 μg/mL) and much better antitumor efficacy than that of mPEG-PCL-Por (MLP) micelles in vivo.",Cancer,reductionsensitive polymeric micelle amplifying oxidative stress vehicle enhanced antitumor therapy,chemotherapyphotodynamic therapy pdtbased combination therapy currently frequently used mean cancer treatment photosensitizer able generate reactive oxygen specie ro improving chemotherapy owing high oxidative stress tumor microenvironment tme whereas cancer cell accustomed oxidative stress overexpression antioxidant glutathione gsh would consume damage ro well could result ineffective treatment herein amplification oxidative stress preferentially tumor cell consuming gsh generating ro reasonable treatment strategy develop anticancer drug achieve excellent therapeutic effect designed gshscavenging rosgenerating polymeric micelle mpegsspclpor mslp amplifying oxidative stress enhanced anticancer therapy amphiphilic polymer methoxy polyethylene glycol mpegsspolyεcaprolactone pclprotoporphyrin selfassembled polymeric micelle anticancer drug doxorubicin dox treatment tracking via fret spherical doxmslp micelle average size nm procured negatively charged surface reduction sensitivity high drug loading content intracellular ro detection showed mslp could deplete glutathione regenerate additional ro cellular uptake doxmslp micelle grabbed realtime monitoring fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret effect dox mslp reductionsensitive polymeric micelle mslp amplifying oxidative stress vehicle combined chemotherapy pdt exhibited significant antitumor activity vitro ic μgml much better antitumor efficacy mpegpclpor mlp micelle vivo

21,33862560,MiR-25 and KLF4 relationship has early prognostic significance in the development of cervical cancer.,"Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the common cancer types among women. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in the formation and development of many cancer types by regulating expression of their targets. While many studies have investigated the relationship between miRNAs and cervical cancer, no robust miRNA biomarkers have been defined yet for diagnosis of cervical lesions. In this study, we performed a statistical meta-analysis to identify miRNAs and a class compassion analysis to evaluate mRNAs with the power to discriminate between normal, intraepithelial lesions and invasive cancer samples. Differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs were compared with the targets of meta-miRNAs. After bioinfomatics analysis and qRT-PCR validations with cytology samples and FFPE tissues, we defined miR-25 and its target KLF4 (Kruppel-like factor 4) as candidate biomarkers for in vitro studies. Our results showed that miR-25 expression was significantly higher in precancerous lesions and invasive carcinoma while presenting consistent expression patterns in both cytological and FFPE tissue samples. In line with this, its direct target KLF4 expression decreased in precancerous lesions in cytological samples and also in the invasive cancer group in FFPE tissues. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that mir-25 inhibition decreased proliferation and motility of HeLa cells and promoted an increase in the protein level of KLF4. We conclude that inhibition of miR-25 may upregulate KLF4 expression and regulate cell proliferation and motility in cervical cancer.",Cancer,mir klf relationship early prognostic significance development cervical cancer,cervical squamous cell carcinoma scc one common cancer type among woman micrornas mirnas small noncoding rna play important role formation development many cancer type regulating expression target many study investigated relationship mirnas cervical cancer robust mirna biomarkers defined yet diagnosis cervical lesion study performed statistical metaanalysis identify mirnas class compassion analysis evaluate mrna power discriminate normal intraepithelial lesion invasive cancer sample differentially expressed mrna compared target metamirnas bioinfomatics analysis qrtpcr validation cytology sample ffpe tissue defined mir target klf kruppellike factor candidate biomarkers vitro study result showed mir expression significantly higher precancerous lesion invasive carcinoma presenting consistent expression pattern cytological ffpe tissue sample line direct target klf expression decreased precancerous lesion cytological sample also invasive cancer group ffpe tissue furthermore vitro study showed mir inhibition decreased proliferation motility hela cell promoted increase protein level klf conclude inhibition mir may upregulate klf expression regulate cell proliferation motility cervical cancer
22,33862559,Physician practice variation in head and neck cancer therapy: Results of a national survey.,"Choice between surgical or medical treatments in head and neck cancer depends of many patient-related and disease-related factors. We investigated how patients' socioeconomic status and practitioners' specialty could affect medical decision-making.
We conducted a cross-sectional online, nationwide survey, send to surgeons, oncologists and radiotherapists specialized in head and neck oncology. We collected data on medical decision-making for seven clinical scientific scenarios involving head and neck carcinoma and physicians' demographic data. Patients' gender and socioeconomic position were distributed across scientific scenarios using a Latin square design. The scientific scenarios were grouped into several categories according to the prognostic and functional impact of the therapeutic choice.
We obtained 206 assessable answers. Surgeons seemed to propose surgery in 49% of cases, whereas oncologists and radiotherapists opted for it in 34% of cases only. This was particularly relevant when the oncological result of surgery and the medical approach were equivalent, and when the surgery appeared to be superior in terms of curative potential but was burdened by a large functional impact. Patient's socioeconomic position also influence therapeutic decision. Among surgeons, the ""single male manager"" had significantly more chance of being offered surgery than the ""married male blue-collar worker"". Among oncologists and radiotherapists, the ""single male blue-collar worker"" had the lowest probability of being proposed surgery. Regarding gender, surgeons tended to offer surgical management more to women regardless of their clinical profile.

23,33862558,"PARP inhibitors in head and neck cancer: Molecular mechanisms, preclinical and clinical data.","Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have revolutionized the treatment landscape in several cancers. PARPi increase DNA damage particularly in tumors with underlying defects in DNA repair. In addition to PARPi-induced DNA damage, PARPi enhance immune priming and induce adaptive upregulation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are characterized by aberrant DNA repair pathways, including nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER) and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair and these deregulated repair mechanisms are implicated in both the pathogenesis of the disease and the outcome of therapy. Cisplatin represents the cornerstone of treatment of HNSCC and cisplatin resistance impedes successful treatment outcomes. To this end, research strategies that are testing modulation of cisplatin sensitivity by PARPi are of particular interest. Moreover, given the immune modulating effects of PARPi and the recent approval of Programmed Cell Death- 1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC, the design of trials combining PARPi and PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors represent a rational research strategy.

Recently advances in immunotherapy have improved the therapeutic repository for LUSC, but there is still an urgent need for novel targets and biomarkers. We examined 73 cases of LUSC for relative copy number amplification of DCUN1D1, BCL9, FGFR1 and ERBB2 genes and searched for correlations with molecular alterations and clinicopathological characteristics. In our cohort BCL9 gene was amplified in 57.5 % of the cases, followed by DCUN1D1 in 37 %, FGFR1 in 19 % whereas none of the cases were amplified in ERBB2 gene. The majority of the samples exhibited amplification in at least one gene while half of them displayed concurrent amplification of two/three genes. Interestingly, 93 % of the FGFR1 amplified cases were also found co amplified with DCUN1D1 and/or BCL9 genes. Linear correlations were found between BCL9 and DCUN1D1 as well as BCL9 and FGFR1 gene amplification. BCL9 and DCUN1D1 genes' amplification was correlated with poorly differentiated tumors (p = 0.035 and p = 0.056 respectively), implying their possible role in tumor aggressiveness. This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge that examines the correlation of DCUN1D1 and BCL9 genes relative copy number amplification with molecular alterations and clinicopathologic characteristics of squamous cell lung cancer tissue samples.

Based on the available knowledge, the immune system and its components are involved in the pathogenesis of several malignancies, including BC. Cancer immunobiology suggests that immune cells can play a dual role and induce anti-tumor or immunosuppressive responses, depending on the tumor microenvironment (TME) signals. The most important effector immune cells with anti-tumor properties are natural killer (NK) cells, B, and T lymphocytes. On the other hand, immune and non-immune cells with regulatory/inhibitory phenotype, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Bregs), tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and regulatory natural killer cells (NKregs), can promote the growth and development of tumor cells by inhibiting anti-tumor responses, inducing angiogenesis and metastasis, as well as the expression of inhibitory molecules and suppressor mediators of the immune system. However, due to the complexity of the interaction and the modification in the immune cells' phenotype and the networking of the immune responses, the exact mechanism of action of the immunosuppressive and regulatory cells is not yet fully understood.

Creatinine levels are the marker of the late stages of prostate cancer. Early and sensitive detection of creatinine can reduce deaths associated with prostate cancer. In this work, nitrogen-doped porous carbon antimony (Sb/NPC) nanoparticles are fabricated to be employed as a non-enzymatic biosensor. Sb/NPC has promising redox activity and is synthesized by a two-step reaction using low-cost precursors. Electrochemical sensing by Sb/NPC is conducted for standard creatinine solutions on a three-electrodes system. Cyclic voltammetry, amperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used to sense creatinine. LOD and LOQ of the Sb/NPC modified electrode are 0.74 µM and 2.4 µM, respectively. This electrode system analyzes creatinine in the serum of prostate cancer patients who have elevated PSA levels.

However, this picture is not as colorful when it comes to the treatment of solid tumors mainly due to the lack of definitive tumor antigens, as well as the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and poor CAR-T infiltration. The recent developments in bioinformatics and cell biology, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, have offered silver linings in the subject of tumor antigen discovery. In the current review, we summarize the development of some CAR-T therapies that target novel tumor antigens, rather than the traditionally CAR-T-targeted ones, and briefly discuss the clinical antitumor achievements of those evaluated in patients, so far.

TNBC cell proliferation and progression to metastasis can be suppressed by inducing cytostatic autophagy. mTOR is closely related to autophagy and is involved in protein synthesis, nutrient metabolism and activating mTOR promotes tumor growth and metastasis. In this paper, we adopted the strategy of structure simplification, aimed to look for novel small-molecule inhibitors of mTOR by pharmacophore-based virtual screening and biological activity determination. We found a lead compound with 3-bromo-N'-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)-4-methylbenzohydrazide for rational drug design and structural modification, then studied its structure-activity relationship. After that, compound 7c with the best TNBC cells inhibitory activities and superior mTOR enzyme inhibitory activity was obtained. In addition, we found that compound 7c could induce autophagic cell death and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines.

32,33862496,Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in solid tumours: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-inhibitors (PARPis) showed antitumour activity in BRCA1/2-mutated cancers, with more heterogeneous outcomes in tumours harbouring mutations that impair other genes involved in the DNA homologous recombination repair (HRR) or wild-type (wt).
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to better assess the role of PARPis in the treatment of metastatic solid tumours, with and without BRCA1/2 mutations. The primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary end-points were overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). A random-effects model was applied.
Twenty-nine studies (8,839 patients) were included. PFS was significantly improved (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51-0.68, p < 0.001), without being affected by BRCA mutational status (p = 0.65). Significant subgroup differences were observed with regard to the tumour site (p = 0.001), line of therapy (p = 0.002), control arm (p < 0.001), type of PARPi (p < 0.001) and trials' phase (p = 0.006). PARPis were associated with ORR (relative risk: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.16-1.56, p < 0.001), with significant subgroup differences observed with regard to treatment line (p = 0.03), control arm (p = 0.04) and PARPis (p < 0.001) and independent of mutational status (p = 0.44), tumour site (p = 0.86) and trials' phase (p = 0.09). OS was significantly improved by PARPis (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.80-0.92, p < 0.001), regardless of mutational status (p = 0.57), tumour site (p = 0.82), treatment line (p = 0.22), control arm (p = 0.21), PARPis (p = 0.30) and trials' phase (p = 0.26). Finally, an exploratory subgroup analysis showed a significant PFS improvement (HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.43-0.60, p < 0.001) with PARPis in BRCA-wt/HRR-deficient tumours.

We aimed to evaluate the treatment strategies, outcomes, and predictors of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) in patients with hematologic malignancy.
We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of eight institutions through the Venous thromboEmbolism Network US. Patients with hematologic malignancies with documented CRT were identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnostic codes. Semi-competing risks proportional hazard regression models were created.
Of the 663 patients in the cohort, 124 (19%) were treated with anticoagulation alone, 388 (58%) were treated with anticoagulation and catheter removal, 119 (18%) treated with catheter removal only, and 32 (5%) had neither catheter removal nor anticoagulation. 100 (15%) patients experienced a recurrent VTE event. In the 579 patients who had catheter removal, the most common reason for catheter removal was the CRT [392 (68%)]. For subjects who received any anticoagulation (n = 512), total anticoagulation duration was not associated with VTE recurrence [1.000 (0.999-1.002)]. After adjustment patients treated with catheter removal only had an increased risk of VTE recurrence [2.50 (1.24-5.07)] and death [4.96 (2.47-9.97)]. Patients with no treatment had increased risk of death [16.81 (6.22-45.38)] and death after VTE recurrence [27.29 (3.13-238.13)]. In this large, multicenter retrospective cohort, we found significant variability in the treatment of CRT in patients with hematologic malignancy.

36,33862460,SPOP suppresses testicular germ cell tumors progression through ubiquitination and degradation of DPPA2.,"Dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is strongly associated with cancer initiation and progression. Speckle-type POZ(pox virus and zinc finger protein) protein(SPOP) is an adapter protein of CUL3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. Gene expression profiling from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) suggests that SPOP is downregulated in testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), but the specific contribution of this protein remains to be explored. In this study, we show that the germ line-specific factor DPPA2 was identified as a proteolytic substrate for the SPOP-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex. SPOP specifically binds to a SPOP-binding consensus (SBC) degron located in DPPA2 and targets DPPA2 for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. SPOP downregulation increases the expression of pluripotency markers OCT4 and Nanog but decreases that of early differentiation marker gene Fst. This effect is partly dependent on its activity toward DPPA2. In addition, the dysregulation of SPOP-DPPA2 axis contributes to the malignant transformation phenotypes of TGCT cells.",Cancer,spop suppresses testicular germ cell tumor progression ubiquitination degradation dppa,dysregulation ubiquitinproteasome pathway strongly associated cancer initiation progression speckletype pozpox virus zinc finger protein proteinspop adapter protein culbased ubiquitin ligase complex gene expression profiling cancer genome atlas tcga suggests spop downregulated testicular germ cell tumor tgcts specific contribution protein remains explored study show germ linespecific factor dppa identified proteolytic substrate spopculrbx ubiquitinligase complex spop specifically bind spopbinding consensus sbc degron located dppa target dppa degradation via ubiquitinproteasome pathway spop downregulation increase expression pluripotency marker oct nanog decrease early differentiation marker gene fst effect partly dependent activity toward dppa addition dysregulation spopdppa axis contributes malignant transformation phenotype tgct cell

As input, a survey of the current structure of radiotherapy MPE national training schemes (NTS) in Europe was carried out.
A 35-question survey was sent to all European medical physics national societies (NS) with a focus on existence of an NTS, its format and duration, required entry-level education, and financial support for trainees.
Twenty-six of 36 NS responded. Twenty had an NTS. Minimum required pre-training education varied from BSc in physics or related sciences (5/2) to MSc in medical physics, physics or related sciences (6/5/2) with 50-210 ECTS in fundamental physics and mathematics. The training period varied from 1 to 5 years (median 3 years with 50% dedicated to radiotherapy). The ratio of time spent on university lectures versus hospital training was most commonly 25%/75%. In 14 of 20 countries with an NTS, a research project was mandatory. Residents were paid in 17 of 20 countries. The recognition was mostly obtained by examination. Medical physics is recognised as a healthcare profession in 19 of 26 countries.
The NTS entrance level, duration and curriculum showed significant variations. This survey serves to inform the design of the updated CC to define a realistic minimum training level for safe and effective practice aiming at further harmonization in line with EC guidelines.",Cancer,towards updated estroefomp core curriculum education training medical physic expert radiotherapy survey current education training practice europe,estroefomp intend update core curriculum cc education training medical physicist radiotherapy line european commission ec guideline medical physic expert mpe canmeds methodology recent development radiotherapy input survey current structure radiotherapy mpe national training scheme nt europe carried question survey sent european medical physic national society n focus existence nt format duration required entrylevel education financial support trainee twentysix n responded twenty nt minimum required pretraining education varied bsc physic related science msc medical physic physic related science ect fundamental physic mathematics training period varied year median year dedicated radiotherapy ratio time spent university lecture versus hospital training commonly country nt research project mandatory resident paid country recognition mostly obtained examination medical physic recognised healthcare profession country nt entrance level duration curriculum showed significant variation survey serf inform design updated cc define realistic minimum training level safe effective practice aiming harmonization line ec guideline

40,33862416,Does participation in ethics discussions have an impact on ethics decision-making? A cross-sectional study among healthcare professionals in paediatric oncology.,"The overall aim of this study was to describe perceptions of the decision-making process in relation to participation/non-participation in ethics discussions among healthcare professionals in paediatric oncology.
Healthcare professionals, working at three paediatric units where ethics discussions where performed answered a study-specific questionnaire focusing on perceptions of involvement, influence, responsibility and understanding of ethics decision-making. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, non-parametric paired t-tests and correlation tests.
Participation in ethics discussions was related to perceptions of greater involvement and the possibility of influencing decisions, as well as formal/shared responsibility for the ethics decisions related to patient care. Medical doctors and registered nurses perception of involvement in decisions, possibility to influence and responsibility decreased when they were not present during the ethics discussion or when no ethics discussion was conducted at all. Healthcare professionals had a generally good understanding of the ethical issues and the ethics decisions. The whole group considered medical doctors to be the most important participants in the ethics discussions, followed by patients/family. Healthcare professionals wanted more teamwork and viewed ethics discussions as very helpful for teamwork when dealing with ethical issues in paediatric oncology.
Ethics discussions in paediatric oncology practice increases the involvement within and the understanding of the decision-making process about ethical decisions. The understanding is not always dependent on participation, indicating a great trust in team members. Based on these findings the implementation of a structure for ethics support in paediatric oncology where patients/families are integrated is recommended.",Cancer,participation ethic discussion impact ethic decisionmaking crosssectional study among healthcare professional paediatric oncology,overall aim study describe perception decisionmaking process relation participationnonparticipation ethic discussion among healthcare professional paediatric oncology healthcare professional working three paediatric unit ethic discussion performed answered studyspecific questionnaire focusing perception involvement influence responsibility understanding ethic decisionmaking statistical analysis included descriptive statistic nonparametric paired ttests correlation test participation ethic discussion related perception greater involvement possibility influencing decision well formalshared responsibility ethic decision related patient care medical doctor registered nurse perception involvement decision possibility influence responsibility decreased present ethic discussion ethic discussion conducted healthcare professional generally good understanding ethical issue ethic decision whole group considered medical doctor important participant ethic discussion followed patientsfamily healthcare professional wanted teamwork viewed ethic discussion helpful teamwork dealing ethical issue paediatric oncology ethic discussion paediatric oncology practice increase involvement within understanding decisionmaking process ethical decision understanding always dependent participation indicating great trust team member based finding implementation structure ethic support paediatric oncology patientsfamilies integrated recommended
41,33862415,Inverse correlation between PD-L1 expression and LGR5 expression in tumor budding of stage II/III colorectal cancer.,"We investigated the expression of LGR5, the most robust and reliable known cancer stem cell (CSC) marker of colorectal cancer, and PD-L1 in tumor budding (TB), as well as clinicopathological features. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were generated from TB samples from 32 stage II/III colorectal adenocarcinoma patients, and LGR5 expression in TMAs was evaluated by RNAscope, an extremely sensitive RNA in situ hybridization technique. LGR5 expression was significantly lower in the PD-L1-positive group than in the PD-L1-negative group (P = 0.0256). In the PD-L1-positive group, the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) score tended to be higher while the TNM stage was lower compared with the PD-L1 negative group (P = 0.0822 and P = 0.0765, respectively). There was no significant difference in Overall Survival between the PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative groups (log-rank test, P = 0.8218). This study showed that PD-L1-positive patients are a unique population with low LGR5 expression, and that LGR5-positive cells may be a promising therapeutic target in PD-L1-negative patients.",Cancer,inverse correlation pdl expression lgr expression tumor budding stage iiiii colorectal cancer,investigated expression lgr robust reliable known cancer stem cell csc marker colorectal cancer pdl tumor budding tb well clinicopathological feature tissue microarrays tmas generated tb sample stage iiiii colorectal adenocarcinoma patient lgr expression tmas evaluated rnascope extremely sensitive rna situ hybridization technique lgr expression significantly lower pdlpositive group pdlnegative group p pdlpositive group tumorinfiltrating lymphocyte tils score tended higher tnm stage lower compared pdl negative group p p respectively significant difference overall survival pdlpositive pdlnegative group logrank test p study showed pdlpositive patient unique population low lgr expression lgrpositive cell may promising therapeutic target pdlnegative patient
42,33862414,Kidney cancer mortality disparities among Hispanics in the US.,"Kidney cancer incidence is increasing among Hispanics but rate differences by distinct group, such as Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Mexican have not been studied. To fill this knowledge gap, we use mortality data, reflecting fatal kidney cancers, to examine patterns by race-ethnicity, including detailed Hispanic groups, and correlate the mortality rates with each group's prevalence of known kidney cancer risk factors: smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.
We used individual-level death data for California, Florida, and New York (2008-2018), and population prevalence data from the National Health Interview Surveys (2008-2018). Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) and regression-derived mortality rate ratios (MRRs) were computed. Pearson correlation analyses assessed the extent to which group-specific risk factor prevalence explained variability in observed AAMRs.
US-born Mexican Americans and American Indians had the highest rates and MRRs compared to Whites: 1.44 (95 %CI: 1.35-1.53) and 1.51 (1.38-1.64) for Mexican American men and women, respectively, and 1.54 (95 %CI: 1.25-1.89) and 1.53 (95 %CI: 1.15-2.04) for American Indians. In contrast, non-Mexican Hispanics had lower rates than Whites. Among males, positive correlations between AAMRs and smoking, obesity, and chronic kidney disease prevalence by race-ethnicity were found.
Mexican Americans and American Indians are high-risk for fatal kidney cancer. Disparities are only partially attributable to higher smoking and obesity prevalence, and more so among men than women. A shared risk factor profile, as well as possible genetic similarities, may explain their disproportionately higher kidney cancer mortality, but further research is warranted.",Cancer,kidney cancer mortality disparity among hispanic u,kidney cancer incidence increasing among hispanic rate difference distinct group cuban puerto rican mexican studied fill knowledge gap use mortality data reflecting fatal kidney cancer examine pattern raceethnicity including detailed hispanic group correlate mortality rate group prevalence known kidney cancer risk factor smoking obesity hypertension diabetes chronic kidney disease used individuallevel death data california florida new york population prevalence data national health interview survey ageadjusted mortality rate aamrs regressionderived mortality rate ratio mrrs computed pearson correlation analysis assessed extent groupspecific risk factor prevalence explained variability observed aamrs usborn mexican american american indian highest rate mrrs compared white ci mexican american men woman respectively ci ci american indian contrast nonmexican hispanic lower rate white among male positive correlation aamrs smoking obesity chronic kidney disease prevalence raceethnicity found mexican american american indian highrisk fatal kidney cancer disparity partially attributable higher smoking obesity prevalence among men woman shared risk factor profile well possible genetic similarity may explain disproportionately higher kidney cancer mortality research warranted
43,33862413,A multi-level spatio-temporal analysis on prostate cancer outcomes.,"Geographic and temporal variation in positive surgical margins (PSM) for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy (RP) has been observed. However, it is unclear how much of this variation could be attributed to patient, surgeon, institution, or socioeconomic-related factors and the impact of PSM on death among localized prostate cancer patients.
This study aimed to assess the independent and relative contribution of the patient, surgeon, institution and area-level risk factors on geographic and temporal variation of PSM and evaluate the impact of PSM on five-year all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality among localized prostate cancer patients. Within the hierarchical-related regression approach, we utilised Bayesian spatial-temporal multi-level models to study individual and area-level predictors with the outcomes, while accounting for geographically structured and unstructured correlation and non-linear trends.
Individual-level data included 10,075 localized prostate cancer cases with RP reported to the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry Victoria between 2009 and 2018. Area-level data comprised socio-economic disadvantage and remoteness data at the local government area level in Victoria, Australia. 26 % of patients had PSM, and the rates varied across areas by years. This variation was mainly associated with NCCN risk, followed by RP techniques, surgical institution type, surgeon volume and socio-economic disadvantage. Intermediate (Odds ratio/OR = 1.21,95 % credible interval/Crl = 1.05-1.41), high/very-high risk groups (OR = 2.24,95 % Crl = 1.91-2.64) and public surgical institution (OR = 1.64, 95 % Crl = 1.46-1.84) were independently associated with a higher likelihood of PSM. Robot-assisted (OR = 0.61, 95 % Crl = 0.55-0.68), laparoscopic RP (OR = 0.76, 95 % Crl = 0.62-0.93), high-volume surgeon (OR = 0.84, 95 % Crl = 0.76-0.93) and socio-economically least disadvantaged status (OR = 0.78, 95 % Crl = 0.64-0.94) showed a lower likelihood of PSM. PSM was also independently associated with a higher five-year all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality.
Aggressive tumour characteristics and RP techniques were the main contributors to the likelihood of PSM following RP. Reducing the prevalence of PSM will generally improve prostate cancer-specific and all-cause mortality.",Cancer,multilevel spatiotemporal analysis prostate cancer outcome,geographic temporal variation positive surgical margin psm prostate cancer radical prostatectomy rp observed however unclear much variation could attributed patient surgeon institution socioeconomicrelated factor impact psm death among localized prostate cancer patient study aimed ass independent relative contribution patient surgeon institution arealevel risk factor geographic temporal variation psm evaluate impact psm fiveyear allcause prostate cancerspecific mortality among localized prostate cancer patient within hierarchicalrelated regression approach utilised bayesian spatialtemporal multilevel model study individual arealevel predictor outcome accounting geographically structured unstructured correlation nonlinear trend individuallevel data included localized prostate cancer case rp reported prostate cancer outcome registry victoria arealevel data comprised socioeconomic disadvantage remoteness data local government area level victoria australia patient psm rate varied across area year variation mainly associated nccn risk followed rp technique surgical institution type surgeon volume socioeconomic disadvantage intermediate odds ratioor credible intervalcrl highveryhigh risk group crl public surgical institution crl independently associated higher likelihood psm robotassisted crl laparoscopic rp crl highvolume surgeon crl socioeconomically least disadvantaged status crl showed lower likelihood psm psm also independently associated higher fiveyear allcause prostate cancerspecific mortality aggressive tumour characteristic rp technique main contributor likelihood psm following rp reducing prevalence psm generally improve prostate cancerspecific allcause mortality

45,33862403,"Analysis of periodontitis-associated miRNAs in gingival tissue, gingival crevicular fluid, saliva and blood plasma.","Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic inflammatory disease which is associated with multiple systemic comorbidities, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), meanwhile the etiopathology of PD may be modulated by various factors including microRNA (miRNA). The present study aimed to reveal miRNAs associated with PD in gingival tissue, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), saliva, plasma and to assess the possible influence of RA.
The cross-sectional study included 30 patients with PD and 31 periodontally healthy participants. A total of 25 participants were additionally diagnosed with RA. Microarray analysis of eight gingival tissue samples was performed and four PD-associated miRNAs were selected: miR-199a-5p, miR-483-5p, miR-3198 and miR-4299. Target miRNAs were further assessed by means of RT-qPCR in 61 gingival tissue samples and corresponding bodily fluids - GCF, saliva and plasma.
The upregulation of miR-199a-5p and downregulation of miR-4299 in gingival tissue was associated with the presence of PD and RA (P < 0.05). GCF level of miR-3198 was higher amongst participants with PD (P = 0.019) and showed a good diagnostic ability (AUC = 0.72, P = 0.008). Increased miR-199a-5p salivary level and decreased miR-199a-5p plasma level were observed amongst patients with worse clinical status of PD (P < 0.05).

We aimed to evaluate the association between surrounding greenness and genome-wide DNA methylation and potential gene-greenness interaction effects on DNA methylation.
We measured blood-derived DNA methylation using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (Illumina) for 479 Australian women, including 66 monozygotic, 66 dizygotic twin pairs, and 215 sisters of these twins. Surrounding greenness was represented by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) within 300, 500, 1000 or 2000 m surrounding participants' home addresses. For each cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG), the associations between its methylation level and NDVI or EVI were evaluated by generalized estimating equations, after adjusting for age, education, marital status, area-level socioeconomic status, smoking behavior, cell-type proportions, and familial clustering. We used comb-p and DMRcate to identify significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs). For each significant CpG, we evaluated the interaction effects of greenness and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ±1 Mb window on its methylation level.
We found associations between surrounding greenness and blood DNA methylation for one CpG (cg04720477, mapped to the promoter region of CNP gene) with false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05, and for another 9 CpGs with 0.05 ≤ FDR < 0.10. For two of these CpGs, we found 33 SNPs significantly (FDR < 0.05) modified the greenness-methylation association. There were 35 significant DMRs related to surrounding greenness that were identified by both comb-p (Sidak p-value < 0.01) and DMRcate (FDR < 0.01). Those CpGs and DMRs were mapped to genes related to many human diseases, such as mental health disorders and neoplasms as well as nutritional and metabolic diseases.

48,33862354,Retinex model based stain normalization technique for whole slide image analysis.,"Medical imaging provides the means for diagnosing many of the medical phenomena currently studied in clinical medicine and pathology. The variations of color and intensity in stained histological slides affect the quantitative analysis of the histopathological images. Moreover, stain normalization utilizing color for the classification of pixels into different stain components is challenging. The staining also suffers from variability, which complicates the automatization of tissue area segmentation with different staining and the analysis of whole slide images. We have developed a Retinex model based stain normalization technique in terms of area segmentation from stained tissue images to quantify the individual stain components of the histochemical stains for the ideal removal of variability. The performance was experimentally compared to reference methods and tested on organotypic carcinoma model based on myoma tissue and our method consistently has the smallest standard deviation, skewness value, and coefficient of variation in normalized median intensity measurements. Our method also achieved better quality performance in terms of Quaternion Structure Similarity Index Metric (QSSIM), Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) by improving robustness against variability and reproducibility.

49,33862352,Efficiency of aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-photodynamic therapy based on ALA uptake transporters in a cell density-dependent malignancy model.,"The effectiveness of the conventional chemotherapy for cancer are compromised as the cancer cells advances in their malignancy level as they acquired drug resistance. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficiency of aminolevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) against cancer of various malignancy levels, indicated by the expression level of receptor associated nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), through the expression levels of ALA uptake transporters. We established a malignancy model by gradually increasing the cell density of cancer cells. Western blotting was used to study the expression levels of RANKL, ALA uptake transporters and the cell density-dependent Yes-associated protein (YAP) under different cell densities. The amount of protoporphyrin (PpIX) produced and cell viability were then studied using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ALA-PDT assay. Our study showed that the amount of PpIX production doubled in high cell density/cancer malignancy cultures and the effectiveness of ALA-PDT when subjected to light irradiation at 635 nm are significantly at higher cancer malignancy. We observed that the expression levels of ALA uptake transporters and YAP correlated with higher cell density/cancer malignancy, suggesting a possible relationship among these three factors. These findings suggest that ALA-PDT is more effective in cancer cells of higher malignancy due to the upregulation of transporters involved in ALA uptake.",Cancer,efficiency aminolevulinic acid alaphotodynamic therapy based ala uptake transporter cell densitydependent malignancy model,effectiveness conventional chemotherapy cancer compromised cancer cell advance malignancy level acquired drug resistance study aimed evaluate efficiency aminolevulinic acidphotodynamic therapy alapdt cancer various malignancy level indicated expression level receptor associated nuclear factorκb ligand rankl expression level ala uptake transporter established malignancy model gradually increasing cell density cancer cell western blotting used study expression level rankl ala uptake transporter cell densitydependent yesassociated protein yap different cell density amount protoporphyrin ppix produced cell viability studied using high performance liquid chromatography hplc alapdt assay study showed amount ppix production doubled high cell densitycancer malignancy culture effectiveness alapdt subjected light irradiation nm significantly higher cancer malignancy observed expression level ala uptake transporter yap correlated higher cell densitycancer malignancy suggesting possible relationship among three factor finding suggest alapdt effective cancer cell higher malignancy due upregulation transporter involved ala uptake

503 patients with pathologically proven lung adenocarcinoma containing information on the mutation status were retrospectively included. Intratumoural and peritumoural radiomic features of the primary lesion were extracted from CT. We proposed two-level stepwise binary radiomics-based classification models to diagnose ALK (step1) and EGFR mutation status (step2). The performance of proposed models and added value of peritumoural radiomic features were evaluated by using the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and Obuchowski index in the development and validation sets.
Regarding the prediction of ALK rearrangement, the diagnostic performance of the intratumoural radiomic model showed the AUC of 0.77 and 0.68 for the development and validation sets, respectively. As for EGFR mutation, the diagnostic performance of the intratumoural radiomic model showed the AUCs of 0.64 and 0.62 for the development and validation sets, respectively. The radiomics added value to the model based on clinical features (development set [radiomics + clinical model vs. clinical model]: Obuchowski index, 0.76 vs. 0.66, p < 0.001; validation set: 0.69 vs. 0.61, p = 0.075). Adding peritumoural features resulted in no improvement in terms of model performance.

54,33862284,Dual-responsive nanohybrid based on degradable silica-coated gold nanorods for triple-combination therapy for breast cancer.,"Multi-modal combination therapy has attracted great attention, owing to the unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy of conventional chemotherapy. Mesoporous silica-coated gold nanorods possess great potential in photothermal therapy and drug delivery. In this work, we fabricate a dual-responsive nanohybrid for combination treatment of the malignant tumor. In this system, gold nanorods are coated with the degradable mesoporous silica, and the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin (DOX) and photosensitizer (IR820) are co-loaded inside the pores of the silica. The encapsulation of hyaluronic acid (HA) endow the nanohybrids with mammary carcinoma targeting ability and better biocompatibility, owning to CD44+ receptor overexpressed in some cancer cells. As-prepared nanohybrids exhibit high responsiveness to a high glutathione (GSH) level and degrade rapidly in the presence of hyaluronidase (HAase) and GSH after endocytosis by 4T1 cells, allowing the efficient release of loaded DOX and IR 820 in tumor sites. Interestingly, near-infrared (NIR) laser not only triggers the generation of reactive oxygen species, but also remarkable photothermal efficacy originating from GNRs. Therefore, upon the irradiation of 808 nm NIR light, the combinatorial photodynamic, photothermal and chemotherapy is achieved, accordingly leading to a highly efficient antitumor outcome in vitro and in vivo. This strategy provides an ideal approach to constructing multimodal cancer therapy system. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: • Dual-responsive nanohybrids for combinatorial therapy of breast cancer. • The nanohybrids exhibit both HAase and GSH stimuli-responsive behavior. • The nanohybrids exhibit light-activated PDT/PTT/chemotherapy. • The nanohybrids show good biosafety for potential clinical application.",Cancer,dualresponsive nanohybrid based degradable silicacoated gold nanorods triplecombination therapy breast cancer,multimodal combination therapy attracted great attention owing unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy conventional chemotherapy mesoporous silicacoated gold nanorods posse great potential photothermal therapy drug delivery work fabricate dualresponsive nanohybrid combination treatment malignant tumor system gold nanorods coated degradable mesoporous silica chemotherapy drug doxorubicin dox photosensitizer ir coloaded inside pore silica encapsulation hyaluronic acid endow nanohybrids mammary carcinoma targeting ability better biocompatibility owning cd receptor overexpressed cancer cell asprepared nanohybrids exhibit high responsiveness high glutathione gsh level degrade rapidly presence hyaluronidase haase gsh endocytosis cell allowing efficient release loaded dox ir tumor site interestingly nearinfrared nir laser trigger generation reactive oxygen specie also remarkable photothermal efficacy originating gnrs therefore upon irradiation nm nir light combinatorial photodynamic photothermal chemotherapy achieved accordingly leading highly efficient antitumor outcome vitro vivo strategy provides ideal approach constructing multimodal cancer therapy system statement significance dualresponsive nanohybrids combinatorial therapy breast cancer nanohybrids exhibit haase gsh stimuliresponsive behavior nanohybrids exhibit lightactivated pdtpttchemotherapy nanohybrids show good biosafety potential clinical application

However, our picture of dynamic changes during inflammation remains far from comprehensive.
Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics to elucidate changes in distinct cell types and their interactions in a mouse model of chemically induced colitis.
Our analysis highlights the stromal cell population of the colon functions as a hub with dynamically changing roles over time. Importantly, we found that Serpina3n, a serine protease inhibitor, is specifically expressed in stromal cell clusters as inflammation resolves, interacting with a potential target, Elastase. Indeed, genetic ablation of the Serpina3n gene delays resolution of induced inflammation. Furthermore, systemic Serpina3n administration promoted the resolution of inflammation, ameliorating colitis symptoms.

57,33862250,Tumor hypoxia: the major culprit behind cisplatin resistance in cancer patients.,"Cisplatin is the most commonly used first-line drug for cancer treatment. However, many patients develop resistance to cisplatin therapy which ultimately results in therapy failure and increased mortality. A growing body of evidence shows that the hypoxic microenvironment is the prime factor underlying tumor insensitivity to cisplatin treatment. Since tumors in the majority of cancer patients are under hypoxic stress (low oxygen supply), it becomes necessary to understand the pathobiology behind hypoxia-induced cisplatin resistance in cancer cells. Here, we discuss the molecular events that render hypoxic tumors insensitive to cisplatin therapy. Furthermore, various drugs and tumor oxygenation techniques have been developed to circumvent cisplatin resistance in hypoxic tumors. However, their pharmaceutical applications are limited due to failures in clinical investigations and a lack of preclinical studies in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. This review addresses these challenges and provides new directions for the strategic deployment of cisplatin sensitizers in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.",Cancer,tumor hypoxia major culprit behind cisplatin resistance cancer patient,cisplatin commonly used firstline drug cancer treatment however many patient develop resistance cisplatin therapy ultimately result therapy failure increased mortality growing body evidence show hypoxic microenvironment prime factor underlying tumor insensitivity cisplatin treatment since tumor majority cancer patient hypoxic stress low oxygen supply becomes necessary understand pathobiology behind hypoxiainduced cisplatin resistance cancer cell discus molecular event render hypoxic tumor insensitive cisplatin therapy furthermore various drug tumor oxygenation technique developed circumvent cisplatin resistance hypoxic tumor however pharmaceutical application limited due failure clinical investigation lack preclinical study hypoxic tumor microenvironment review address challenge provides new direction strategic deployment cisplatin sensitizer hypoxic tumor microenvironment
58,33862249,Current treatment options for HER2-positive breast cancer patients with brain metastases.,"Brain metastases (BMs) are frequently associated with HER2+ breast cancer (BC). Their management is based on a multi-modal strategy including both local treatment and systemic therapy. Despite therapeutic advance, BMs still have an adverse impact on survival and quality of life and the development of effective systemic therapy to prevent and treat BMs from HER2 + BC represents an unmet clinical need. Trastuzumab-based therapy has long been the mainstay of systemic therapy and over the last two decades other HER2-targeted agents including lapatinib, pertuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine, have been introduced in the clinical practice. More recently, novel agents such as neratinib, tucatinib and trastuzumab deruxtecan have been developed, with interesting activity against BMs. Further research is needed to better elucidate the best sequence of these agents and their combination with local treatment.",Cancer,current treatment option herpositive breast cancer patient brain metastasis,brain metastasis bm frequently associated breast cancer bc management based multimodal strategy including local treatment systemic therapy despite therapeutic advance bm still adverse impact survival quality life development effective systemic therapy prevent treat bm bc represents unmet clinical need trastuzumabbased therapy long mainstay systemic therapy last two decade hertargeted agent including lapatinib pertuzumab trastuzumab emtansine introduced clinical practice recently novel agent neratinib tucatinib trastuzumab deruxtecan developed interesting activity bm research needed better elucidate best sequence agent combination local treatment

63,33862222,Notch signaling in cancer: Complexity and challenges on the path to clinical translation.,"Notch receptors participate in a conserved pathway in which ligands expressed on neighboring cells trigger a series of proteolytic cleavages that allow the intracellular portion of the receptor to travel to the nucleus and form a short-lived transcription complex that turns on target gene expression. The directness and seeming simplicity of this signaling mechanism belies the complexity of the outcomes of Notch signaling in normal cells, which are highly context and dosage dependent. This complexity is reflected in the diverse roles of Notch in cancers of various types, in which Notch may be oncogenic or tumor suppressive and may have a wide spectrum of effects on tumor cells and stromal elements. This review provides an overview of the roles of Notch in cancer and discusses challenges to clinical translation of Notch targeting agents as well as approaches that may overcome these hurdles.",Cancer,notch signaling cancer complexity challenge path clinical translation,notch receptor participate conserved pathway ligand expressed neighboring cell trigger series proteolytic cleavage allow intracellular portion receptor travel nucleus form shortlived transcription complex turn target gene expression directness seeming simplicity signaling mechanism belies complexity outcome notch signaling normal cell highly context dosage dependent complexity reflected diverse role notch cancer various type notch may oncogenic tumor suppressive may wide spectrum effect tumor cell stromal element review provides overview role notch cancer discus challenge clinical translation notch targeting agent well approach may overcome hurdle
64,33862221,AMPK signaling and its targeting in cancer progression and treatment.,"The intrinsic mechanisms sensing the imbalance of energy in cells are pivotal for cell survival under various environmental insults. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a central guardian maintaining energy homeostasis by orchestrating diverse cellular processes, such as lipogenesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, cell cycle progression and mitochondrial dynamics. Given that AMPK plays an essential role in the maintenance of energy balance and metabolism, managing AMPK activation is considered as a promising strategy for the treatment of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Since AMPK has been attributed to aberrant activation of metabolic pathways, mitochondrial dynamics and functions, and epigenetic regulation, which are hallmarks of cancer, targeting AMPK may open up a new avenue for cancer therapies. Although AMPK is previously thought to be involved in tumor suppression, several recent studies have unraveled its tumor promoting activity. The double-edged sword characteristics for AMPK as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene are determined by distinct cellular contexts. In this review, we will summarize recent progress in dissecting the upstream regulators and downstream effectors for AMPK, discuss the distinct roles of AMPK in cancer regulation and finally offer potential strategies with AMPK targeting in cancer therapy.",Cancer,ampk signaling targeting cancer progression treatment,intrinsic mechanism sensing imbalance energy cell pivotal cell survival various environmental insult ampactivated protein kinase ampk serf central guardian maintaining energy homeostasis orchestrating diverse cellular process lipogenesis glycolysis tca cycle cell cycle progression mitochondrial dynamic given ampk play essential role maintenance energy balance metabolism managing ampk activation considered promising strategy treatment metabolic disorder type diabetes obesity since ampk attributed aberrant activation metabolic pathway mitochondrial dynamic function epigenetic regulation hallmark cancer targeting ampk may open new avenue cancer therapy although ampk previously thought involved tumor suppression several recent study unraveled tumor promoting activity doubleedged sword characteristic ampk tumor suppressor oncogene determined distinct cellular context review summarize recent progress dissecting upstream regulator downstream effector ampk discus distinct role ampk cancer regulation finally offer potential strategy ampk targeting cancer therapy

We identified new potential roles of hsa-miR-155-5p in CML, involving the BCR/ABL-mediated leukemogenesis through MAPK signaling. Several promising targets including E2F2, KRAS and FLI1 were screened as candidate diagnostic marker genes. The survival analysis revealed that mRNA expression of E2F2, KRAS and FLI1 was negatively correlated with hsa-miR-155-5p and these targets were significantly associated with poor overall survival. Furthermore, an overlap between CML-related genes and hsa-miR-155-5p target genes was revealed using competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks analysis.

66,33862169,Use of Less-than-Lifetime (LTL) Durational Limits for Nitrosamines: Case Study of N-Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA).,"The ICH M7(R1) guideline describes a framework to assess the carcinogenic risk of mutagenic and carcinogenic pharmaceutical impurities following less-than-lifetime (LTL) exposures. This LTL framework is important as many pharmaceuticals are not administered for a patient's lifetime and as clinical trials typically involve LTL exposures. While there has been regulatory caution about applying LTL concepts to cohort of concern (COC) impurities such as N-nitrosamines, ICH M7 does not preclude this and indeed literature data suggests that the LTL framework will be protective of patient safety for N-nitrosamines. The goal was to investigate if applying the LTL framework in ICH M7 would control exposure to an acceptable excess cancer risk in humans. Using N-nitrosodiethylamine as a case study, empirical data correlating exposure duration (as a percentage of lifespan) and cancer incidence in rodent bioassays indicate that the LTL acceptable intake (AI) as derived using the ICH M7 framework would not exceed a negligible additional risk of cancer. Therefore, controlling N-nitrosamines to an LTL AI based on the ICH M7 framework is thus demonstrated to be protective for potential carcinogenic risk to patients over the exposure durations typical of clinical trials and many prescribed medicines.",Cancer,use lessthanlifetime ltl durational limit nitrosamines case study nnitrosodiethylamine ndea,ich mr guideline describes framework ass carcinogenic risk mutagenic carcinogenic pharmaceutical impurity following lessthanlifetime ltl exposure ltl framework important many pharmaceutical administered patient lifetime clinical trial typically involve ltl exposure regulatory caution applying ltl concept cohort concern coc impurity nnitrosamines ich preclude indeed literature data suggests ltl framework protective patient safety nnitrosamines goal investigate applying ltl framework ich would control exposure acceptable excess cancer risk human using nnitrosodiethylamine case study empirical data correlating exposure duration percentage lifespan cancer incidence rodent bioassay indicate ltl acceptable intake ai derived using ich framework would exceed negligible additional risk cancer therefore controlling nnitrosamines ltl ai based ich framework thus demonstrated protective potential carcinogenic risk patient exposure duration typical clinical trial many prescribed medicine
67,33862168,A call for the standardised reporting of factors affecting the exogenous loading of extracellular vesicles with therapeutic cargos.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are complex nanoparticles required for the intercellular transfer of diverse biological cargoes. Unlike synthetic nanoparticles, EVs may provide a natural platform for the enhanced targeting and functional transfer of therapeutics across complex and often impenetrable biological boundaries (e.g. the blood-brain barrier or the matrix of densely organised tumours). Consequently, there is considerable interest in utilising EVs as advanced drug delivery systems for the treatment of a range of challenging pathologies. Within the past decade, efforts have focused on providing standard minimal requirements for conducting basic EV research. However, no standard reporting framework has been established governing the therapeutic loading of EVs for drug delivery applications. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate progress in the field, providing an initial set of guidelines that can be applied as a benchmark to enhance reproducibility and increase the likelihood of translational outcomes.",Cancer,call standardised reporting factor affecting exogenous loading extracellular vesicle therapeutic cargo,extracellular vesicle ev complex nanoparticles required intercellular transfer diverse biological cargo unlike synthetic nanoparticles ev may provide natural platform enhanced targeting functional transfer therapeutic across complex often impenetrable biological boundary eg bloodbrain barrier matrix densely organised tumour consequently considerable interest utilising ev advanced drug delivery system treatment range challenging pathology within past decade effort focused providing standard minimal requirement conducting basic ev research however standard reporting framework established governing therapeutic loading ev drug delivery application purpose review critically evaluate progress field providing initial set guideline applied benchmark enhance reproducibility increase likelihood translational outcome
68,33862162,Surface stiffness depended gingival mesenchymal stem cell sensitivity to oxidative stress.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in the fields of cell therapy and tissue engineering, due to their wide spectrum of differentiation potential, immunomodulation function and ongoing oxidative stress (OS) reduction. Nevertheless, OS impact is often overlooked in these research fields. It is not only responsible for the induction and development of many ailments, e.g., diabetes, lung fibrosis, and cancer, moreover, OS causes stem cell death and senescence during cell therapy and tissue engineering practices. As MSCs are used to treat various tissues, they interact with different tissue-specific mechanical environments, thus it is important to understand how the mechanical environment impacts MSC sensitivity to OS. In this work, for the first time, as known to the authors, it was shown that gingival MSCs (GMSCs) sensitivity to OS depends on the stiffness of the surface, on which the cells are grown. Furthermore, the activity and expression of mitogen activated protein kinases ERK, JNK, and p38 were surface stiffness dependent. GMSCs isolated from intermediate/stiff gingiva tissue (∼20 kPa) have shown the best proliferative and survival properties, then grown on the stiffest tissues mimicking polyacrylamide hydrogels (40 kPa). Therefore, MSC source might determine their sensitivity to OS in different stiffness environments and should be accounted when developing a treatment strategy.",Cancer,surface stiffness depended gingival mesenchymal stem cell sensitivity oxidative stress,mesenchymal stem cell msc widely used field cell therapy tissue engineering due wide spectrum differentiation potential immunomodulation function ongoing oxidative stress reduction nevertheless impact often overlooked research field responsible induction development many ailment eg diabetes lung fibrosis cancer moreover cause stem cell death senescence cell therapy tissue engineering practice msc used treat various tissue interact different tissuespecific mechanical environment thus important understand mechanical environment impact msc sensitivity work first time known author shown gingival msc gmscs sensitivity depends stiffness surface cell grown furthermore activity expression mitogen activated protein kinase erk jnk p surface stiffness dependent gmscs isolated intermediatestiff gingiva tissue kpa shown best proliferative survival property grown stiffest tissue mimicking polyacrylamide hydrogel kpa therefore msc source might determine sensitivity different stiffness environment accounted developing treatment strategy

We sought to update the estimates of both eligibility for and response to genome-targeted and informed therapies in US cancer patients for FDA-approved drugs to reflect estimates as of 2020.
We used mortality data from the American Cancer Society to estimate eligibility for these drugs, based on prevalence statistics from the published literature. We then multiplied eligibility by the response rate in the FDA label to generate an estimate for the percentage of US cancer patients who respond.
For genome-targeted therapy, we estimate that the eligibility increased from 5.13% in 2006 to 13.60% in 2020. For genome-targeted therapy, we estimate that the response increased from 2.73% in 2006 to 7.04% in 2020.

70,33862151,ESDN inhibits melanoma progression by blocking E-selectin expression in endothelial cells via STAT3.,"An interactive crosstalk between tumor and stroma cells is essential for metastatic melanoma progression. We evidenced that ESDN/DCBLD2/CLCP1 plays a crucial role in endothelial cells during the spread of melanoma. Precisely, increased extravasation and metastasis formation was revealed in ESDN-null mice injected with melanoma cells, even if the primary tumor growth, vessel permeability, and angiogenesis were not enhanced. Interestingly, improved adhesion of melanoma cells to ESDN-depleted endothelial cells was observed, due to the presence of higher levels of E-selectin transcripts/proteins in ESDN-defective cells. In accordance with these results, anticorrelation was observed between ESDN and E-selectin in human endothelial cells. Most importantly, our data revealed that cimetidine, an E-selectin inhibitor, was able to block cell adhesion, extravasation, and metastasis formation in ESDN-null mice, underlying a major role of ESDN in E-selectin transcription upregulation, which according to our data may presumably be linked to STAT3. Based on our results, we propose a protective role for ESDN during the spread of melanoma and reveal its therapeutic potential.",Cancer,esdn inhibits melanoma progression blocking eselectin expression endothelial cell via stat,interactive crosstalk tumor stroma cell essential metastatic melanoma progression evidenced esdndcbldclcp play crucial role endothelial cell spread melanoma precisely increased extravasation metastasis formation revealed esdnnull mouse injected melanoma cell even primary tumor growth vessel permeability angiogenesis enhanced interestingly improved adhesion melanoma cell esdndepleted endothelial cell observed due presence higher level eselectin transcriptsproteins esdndefective cell accordance result anticorrelation observed esdn eselectin human endothelial cell importantly data revealed cimetidine eselectin inhibitor able block cell adhesion extravasation metastasis formation esdnnull mouse underlying major role esdn eselectin transcription upregulation according data may presumably linked stat based result propose protective role esdn spread melanoma reveal therapeutic potential
71,33862150,A mitophagy inhibitor targeting p62 attenuates the leukemia-initiation potential of acute myeloid leukemia cells.,"There has been an increasing focus on the tumorigenic potential of leukemia initiating cells (LICs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite the important role of selective autophagy in the life-long maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), cancer progression, and chemoresistance, the relationship between LICs and selective autophagy remains to be fully elucidated. Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), also known as p62, is a selective autophagy receptor for the degradation of ubiquitinated substrates, and its loss impairs leukemia progression in AML mouse models. In this study, we evaluated the underlying mechanisms of mitophagy in the survival of LICs with XRK3F2, a p62-ZZ inhibitor. We demonstrated that XRK3F2 selectively impaired LICs but spared normal HSCs in both mouse and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) AML models. Mechanistically, we observed that XRK3F2 blocked mitophagy by inhibiting the binding of p62 with defective mitochondria. Our study not only evaluated the effectiveness and safety of XRK3F2 in LICs, but also demonstrated that mitophagy plays an indispensable role in the survival of LICs during AML development and progression, which can be impaired by blocking p62.",Cancer,mitophagy inhibitor targeting p attenuates leukemiainitiation potential acute myeloid leukemia cell,increasing focus tumorigenic potential leukemia initiating cell lics acute myeloid leukemia aml despite important role selective autophagy lifelong maintenance hematopoietic stem cell hscs cancer progression chemoresistance relationship lics selective autophagy remains fully elucidated sequestosome sqstm also known p selective autophagy receptor degradation ubiquitinated substrate loss impairs leukemia progression aml mouse model study evaluated underlying mechanism mitophagy survival lics xrkf pzz inhibitor demonstrated xrkf selectively impaired lics spared normal hscs mouse patientderived tumor xenograft pdx aml model mechanistically observed xrkf blocked mitophagy inhibiting binding p defective mitochondrion study evaluated effectiveness safety xrkf lics also demonstrated mitophagy play indispensable role survival lics aml development progression impaired blocking p
72,33862149,"Mucin expression, epigenetic regulation and patient survival: A toolkit of prognostic biomarkers in epithelial cancers.","Twenty mucin genes have been identified and classified in two groups (encoding secreted and membrane-bound proteins). Secreted mucins participate in mucus formation by assembling a 3-dimensional network via oligomerization, whereas membrane-bound mucins are anchored to the outer membrane mediating extracellular interactions and cell signaling. Both groups have been associated with carcinogenesis progression in epithelial cancers, and are therefore considered as potential therapeutic targets. In the present review, we discuss the link between mucin expression patterns and patient survival and propose mucins as prognosis biomarkers of epithelial cancers (esophagus, gastric, pancreatic, colorectal, lung, breast or ovarian cancers). We also investigate the relationship between mucin expression and overall survival in the TCGA dataset. In particular, epigenetic mechanisms regulating mucin gene expression, such as aberrant DNA methylation and histone modification, are interesting as they are also associated with diagnosis or prognosis significance. Indeed, mucin hypomethylation has been shown to be associated with carcinogenesis progression and was linked to prognosis in colon cancer or PDAC patients. Finally we describe the relationship between mucin expression and non-coding RNAs that also may serve as biomarkers. Altogether the concomitant knowledge of specific mucin-pattern expression and epigenetic regulation could be translated as biomarkers with a better specificity/sensitivity performance in several epithelial cancers.",Cancer,mucin expression epigenetic regulation patient survival toolkit prognostic biomarkers epithelial cancer,twenty mucin gene identified classified two group encoding secreted membranebound protein secreted mucin participate mucus formation assembling dimensional network via oligomerization whereas membranebound mucin anchored outer membrane mediating extracellular interaction cell signaling group associated carcinogenesis progression epithelial cancer therefore considered potential therapeutic target present review discus link mucin expression pattern patient survival propose mucin prognosis biomarkers epithelial cancer esophagus gastric pancreatic colorectal lung breast ovarian cancer also investigate relationship mucin expression overall survival tcga dataset particular epigenetic mechanism regulating mucin gene expression aberrant dna methylation histone modification interesting also associated diagnosis prognosis significance indeed mucin hypomethylation shown associated carcinogenesis progression linked prognosis colon cancer pdac patient finally describe relationship mucin expression noncoding rna also may serve biomarkers altogether concomitant knowledge specific mucinpattern expression epigenetic regulation could translated biomarkers better specificitysensitivity performance several epithelial cancer

Along with its excellent biocompatibility, the prepared HA-β-CD exhibits not only exceptionally high loading capacity for the model drugs doxorubicin and Rhodamine B through the formation of inclusion complexes with the β-CD component, but also the capability of targeted drug delivery to cancerous cells with a high level of expression of CD44 receptors, attributable to its HA component. The polymer can release the drug under slightly acidic conditions. With all its attributes, HA-β-CD may be a promising cancer-cell-targeting drug carrier.",Cancer,βcyclodextringrafted hyaluronic acid supramolecular polysaccharide carrier celltargeted drug delivery,βcyclodextrin βcd grafted onto hyaluronic acid single step generate supramolecular biopolymer haβcd explored targeted drug delivery application along excellent biocompatibility prepared haβcd exhibit exceptionally high loading capacity model drug doxorubicin rhodamine b formation inclusion complex βcd component also capability targeted drug delivery cancerous cell high level expression cd receptor attributable component polymer release drug slightly acidic condition attribute haβcd may promising cancercelltargeting drug carrier
74,33862123,Transcriptome analysis of signaling pathways targeted by Ellagic acid in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.,"Ellagic acid (EA) possesses prominent inhibitory activities against various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our recent study demonstrated EA's activities in reducing HCC cell proliferation and tumor formation. However, the mechanisms of EA to exert its anticancer activities and its primary targets in cancer cells have not been systematically explored.
Cell proliferation assay and flow cytometric analysis were used to examine the effects of EA treatment on viability and apoptosis, respectively, of HepG2 cells. RNA-seq studies and associated pathway analyses by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were employed to determine EA's primary targets. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) in EA-treated HepG2 cells were verified by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Integrative analyses of the RNA-seq dataset with a TCGA dataset derived from HCC patients were conducted to verify EA-targeted genes and signaling pathways. Interaction network analysis of the DEGs, shRNA-mediated knockdown, cell viability assay, and colony formation assay were used to validate EA's primary targets.
EA reduced cell viability, caused DNA damage, and induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase of HepG2 cells. We identified 5765 DEGs encoding proteins with over 2.0-fold changes in EA-treated HepG2 cells by DESeq2. These DEGs showed significant enrichment in the pathways regulating DNA replication and cell cycle progression. As primary targets, p21 was significantly upregulated, while MCM2-7 were uniformly downregulated in response to EA treatment. Consistently, p21 knockdown desensitized liver cells to EA in cell viability and colony formation assays.
EA induced G1 phase arrest and promoted apoptosis of HCC cells through activating the p21 gene and downregulating the MCM2-7 genes, respectively.

75,33862122,An overview of nanomaterial based biosensors for detection of Aflatoxin B1 toxicity in foods.,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is one of the most potent mycotoxin contaminating several foods and feeds. It suppresses immunity and consequently increases mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, hepatotoxicity, embryonic toxicity and increasing morbidity and mortality. Continuous exposure of AFB1 causes liver damage and thus increases the prevalence of cirrhosis and hepatic cancer. This article was planned to provide understanding of AFB1 toxicity and provides future directions for fabrication of cost effective and user-friendly nanomaterials based analytical devices. In the present article various conventional (chromatographic & spectroscopic), modern (PCR & immunoassays) and nanomaterials based biosensing techniques (electrochemical, optical, piezoelectrical and microfluidic) are discussed alongwith their merits and demerits. Nanomaterials based amperometric biosensors are found to be more stable, selective and cost-effective analytical devices in comparison to other biosensors. But many unresolved issues about their stability, toxicity and metabolic fate needs further studies. In-depth studies are needed for development of advanced nanomaterials integrated biosensors for specific, sensitive and fast monitoring of AFB1 toxicity in foods. Integration of biosensing system with micro array technology for simultaneous and automated detection of multiple AFs in real samples is also needed.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of information available in regarding its nephrotoxicity. The purpose of this work was to investigate the impact of cyanocobalamin (COB) and/or calcitriol (CAL) injections on TAMO-induced nephrotoxicity.
Animals were allocated into five groups as follows: normal control group; TAMO (45 mg/kg) administered group; TAMO+COB (6mg/kg, i.p) treated group; TAMO+CAL (0.3 μg/kg, i.p) treated group; TAMO+COB+CAL combination groups.
Renal injury induced by TAMO was confirmed by the alteration in renal function parameters in the serum (urea and creatinine), as well as in the urine (creatinine clearance, total protein and albumin). These results were supported by histopathological examination. Upregulation of renal inflammatory parameters; tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP); and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 as well as in protein expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and cleaved caspase-3 were observed to a greater extent in the TAMO-treated rats compared with the control. Renal fibrosis was also evidenced by a elevation in renal L-hydroxyproline level as well as by histomorphological collagen deposition in TAMO-treated groups compared to the control group. Administration of COB and/or CAL concurrently with TAMO significantly ameliorated the deviation in the above-studied parameters and improved the histopathological renal picture.

Nevertheless, the impact of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-derived exosomes (BMSC-exos) transmitting miR-19b-3p on esophageal cancer (EC) progression remains scarcely studied. We aimed to explore the role of BMSC-exos mediating miR-19b-3p in EC cell growth.
Eighty-three cases of EC patients were included in this study and the expression of miR-19b-3p and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in cancer and adjacent normal tissues from the patients were assessed. BMSCs were cultured and BMSC-exos were extracted, which were then transfected with altered miR-19b-3p and SOCS1 to assess their roles in proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis of EC cells. Targeting relationship between miR-19b-3p and SOCS1 was verified by Targetscan and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. MiR-19b-3p and SOCS1 expression was assessed in TE-2 cells.
MiR-19b-3p was upregulated and SOCS1 was downregulated in EC tissues. BMSC-exos or exosomal miR-19b-3p promoted malignant behaviors of EC cells. MiR-19b-3p was upregulated and targeted SOCS1 in EC cells. MiR-19b-3p inhibition or SOCS1 overexpression suppressed proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT, and induced apoptosis of EC cells. SOCS1 silencing abrogated these effect of miR-19b-3p inhibition on EC cells.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with biliary stent placement is the preferred intervention in such cases. The primary aim of this study was to determine what proportion of patients with surgically unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma undergo ERCP and whether this proportion has changed over time.
We used SEER-Medicare linked data to identify a cohort of individuals diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas head between December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2015 and who did not receive pancreas surgery. ERCP use was measured in the 30 days before and after cancer diagnosis. Additional covariates of interest were extracted for multiple variable analysis.
A total of 14,810 patients met study inclusion and exclusion criteria. 53% (7,034/14,810) underwent ERCP within 30 days of cancer diagnosis. The proportion of patients who underwent ERCP declined from 57% in 2001 to 46% in 2015 (P for trend < 0.001). Among those who underwent ERCP, the mean number of ERCP performed per patient over the year after diagnosis declined from 2.3 (SD:1.6) in 2001 to 1.8 (SD:1.1) in 2015 (P=<0.001). Despite decline in ERCP use, adjusted 1-year survival increased over time.

80,33862103,"Traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology of Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle bark: A comprehensive review.","The dried bark of Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle (BAA), commonly designated as ""Chunpi"" in Chinese, is extensively used as a common traditional medicine in China, Korea, and India. It has been used to treat multiple ailments, including asthma, epilepsy, spermatorrhea, bleeding, and ophthalmic diseases, for thousands of years.
To present a comprehensive and constructive review on the phytochemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, traditional uses, quality control, and toxicology of BAA; to aid the assessment of the therapeutic potential of BAA; to guide researchers working on the development of novel therapeutic agents.
Information related to BAA (from 1960-2020) was retrieved from a wide variety of electronic databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, ScienceDirect, SciFinder, and Google Scholar. Additional information and materials were acquired from Chinese Medicine Monographs, the 2020 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and several web sources, such as the official website of The Plant List and Flora of China. Additionally, perspectives for future investigations and applications of BAA were extensively explored.
Approximately 221 chemical compounds, including alkaloids, quassinoids, phenylpropanoids, triterpenoids, volatile oils, and other compounds, have been isolated and characterized from BAA; among these, the quassinoid ailanthone is the most typical. The crude extracts and active compounds of BAA have been reported to exert a wide range of pharmacological activities, such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, herbicidal, and insecticidal activities. Although BAA is safe when administered at a conventional dose, at higher doses, it exhibits toxicity due to the presence of quassinoids. Thus, more studies are required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BAA.
Modern pharmacological studies have revealed that BAA, as a valuable medicinal resource, possesses the potential to treat a wide variety of ailments, especially, cancer and gastrointestinal inflammation. These studies present a wide range of perspectives for the development of new drugs related to BAA. However, only a few traditional uses are associated with the reported pharmacological activities of BAA and have been confirmed by preclinical and clinical studies.

Open reading frame 10 (ORF10) is a unique SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein, which contains eleven cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes each of nine amino acids in length. Twenty-two unique SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 variants have been identified based on missense mutation found in sequence databases. Some of these mutations are predicted to decrease the stability of ORF10 in silico physicochemical and structural comparative analyses were carried out on SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV ORF10 proteins, which share 97.37% amino acid (aa) homology. Though there is a high degree of ORF10 protein similarity of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV, there are differences of these two ORF10 proteins related to their sub-structure (loop/coil region), solubility, antigenicity and shift from strand to coil at aa position 26 (tyrosine).

Recent data support this by showing that antibiotics inhibit malignant T cells in skin lesions in mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, the most common forms of CTCL. Yet, it remains incompletely characterized how SE fuel disease activity. Here, we show that SE induce expression of the oncogenic microRNA mir-155 in primary malignant T cells. Thus, SE and S. aureus-isolates from lesional patient skin induce mir-155 expression, at least partly, through the IL-2Rg/JAK/STAT5 pathway, and the effect is augmented by the presence of non-malignant T cells. Importantly, mycosis fungoides lesions harbor S. aureus, express pY-STAT5, and display enhanced mir-155 expression, when compared with non-lesional and healthy skin. Preliminary data show that aggressive antibiotic therapy is associated with decreased pY-STAT5 and mir-155 expression in lesional skin in two patients with Sezary syndrome.

We identified, and then validated using CRISPR, genes that controlled fate bias for different dendritic cell (DC) subtypes. This included Bcor as a suppressor of plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and conventional DC type 2 (cDC2) numbers during Flt3 ligand-mediated emergency DC development. We then developed SIS-skew to examine development of wild-type and Bcor-deficient siblings of the same clone in parallel.

85,33862012,Validation of a host blood transcriptomic biomarker for pulmonary tuberculosis in people living with HIV: a prospective diagnostic and prognostic accuracy study.,"A rapid, blood-based triage test that allows targeted investigation for tuberculosis at the point of care could shorten the time to tuberculosis treatment and reduce mortality. We aimed to test the performance of a host blood transcriptomic signature (RISK11) in diagnosing tuberculosis and predicting progression to active pulmonary disease (prognosis) in people with HIV in a community setting.
In this prospective diagnostic and prognostic accuracy study, adults (aged 18-59 years) with HIV were recruited from five communities in South Africa. Individuals with a history of tuberculosis or household exposure to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis within the past 3 years, comorbid risk factors for tuberculosis, or any condition that would interfere with the study were excluded. RISK11 status was assessed at baseline by real-time PCR; participants and study staff were masked to the result. Participants underwent active surveillance for microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis by providing spontaneously expectorated sputum samples at baseline, if symptomatic during 15 months of follow-up, and at 15 months (the end of the study). The coprimary outcomes were the prevalence and cumulative incidence of tuberculosis disease confirmed by a positive Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra, or Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube culture, or a combination of such, on at least two separate sputum samples collected within any 30-day period.
Between March 22, 2017, and May 15, 2018, 963 participants were assessed for eligibility and 861 were enrolled. Among 820 participants with valid RISK11 results, eight (1%) had prevalent tuberculosis at baseline: seven (2·5%; 95% CI 1·2-5·0) of 285 RISK11-positive participants and one (0·2%; 0·0-1·1) of 535 RISK11-negative participants. The relative risk (RR) of prevalent tuberculosis was 13·1 times (95% CI 2·1-81·6) greater in RISK11-positive participants than in RISK11-negative participants. RISK11 had a diagnostic area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 88·2% (95% CI 77·6-96·7), and a sensitivity of 87·5% (58·3-100·0) and specificity of 65·8% (62·5-69·0) at a predefined score threshold (60%). Of those with RISK11 results, eight had primary endpoint incident tuberculosis during 15 months of follow-up. Tuberculosis incidence was 2·5 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0·7-4·4) in the RISK11-positive group and 0·2 per 100 person-years (0·0-0·5) in the RISK11-negative group. The probability of primary endpoint incident tuberculosis was greater in the RISK11-positive group than in the RISK11-negative group (cumulative incidence ratio 16·0 [95% CI 2·0-129·5]). RISK11 had a prognostic AUC of 80·0% (95% CI 70·6-86·9), and a sensitivity of 88·6% (43·5-98·7) and a specificity of 68·9% (65·3-72·3) for incident tuberculosis at the 60% threshold.

86,33862002,Chemotherapy and radiotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancer: an individual patient data network meta-analysis.,"Randomised, controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown the survival benefit of concomitant chemoradiotherapy or hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer. However, the relative efficacy of these treatments is unknown. We aimed to determine whether one treatment was superior to the other.
We did a frequentist network meta-analysis based on individual patient data of meta-analyses evaluating the role of chemotherapy (Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer [MACH-NC]) and of altered fractionation radiotherapy (Meta-Analysis of Radiotherapy in Carcinomas of Head and Neck [MARCH]). Randomised, controlled trials that enrolled patients with non-metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2016, were included. We used a two-step random-effects approach, and the log-rank test, stratified by trial to compare treatments, with locoregional therapy as the reference. Overall survival was the primary endpoint. The global Cochran Q statistic was used to assess homogeneity and consistency and P score to rank treatments (higher scores indicate more effective therapies).
115 randomised, controlled trials, which enrolled patients between Jan 1, 1980, and April 30, 2012, yielded 154 comparisons (28 978 patients with 19 253 deaths and 20 579 progression events). Treatments were grouped into 16 modalities, for which 35 types of direct comparisons were available. Median follow-up based on all trials was 6·6 years (IQR 5·0-9·4). Hyperfractionated radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy (HFCRT) was ranked as the best treatment for overall survival (P score 97%; hazard ratio 0·63 [95% CI 0·51-0·77] compared with locoregional therapy). The hazard ratio of HFCRT compared with locoregional therapy with concomitant chemoradiotherapy with platinum-based chemotherapy (CLRT

87,33862001,"Patient-centred outcomes and effect of disease progression on health status in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation receiving maintenance olaparib or placebo (SOLO1): a randomised, phase 3 trial.","In the phase 3 SOLO1 trial, maintenance olaparib provided a significant progression-free survival benefit versus placebo in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation in response after platinum-based chemotherapy. We analysed health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and patient-centred outcomes in SOLO1, and the effect of radiological disease progression on health status.
SOLO1 is a randomised, double-blind, international trial done in 118 centres and 15 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-1; had newly diagnosed, advanced, high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer with a BRCA mutation; and were in clinical complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to either 300 mg olaparib tablets or placebo twice per day using an interactive voice and web response system and were treated for up to 2 years. Treatment assignment was masked for patients and for clinicians giving the interventions, and those collecting and analysing the data. Randomisation was stratified by response to platinum-based chemotherapy (clinical complete or partial response). HRQOL was a secondary endpoint and the prespecified primary HRQOL endpoint was the change from baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Cancer Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score for the first 24 months. TOI scores range from 0 to 100 (higher scores indicated better HRQOL), with a clinically meaningful difference defined as a difference of at least 10 points. Prespecified exploratory endpoints were quality-adjusted progression-free survival and time without significant symptoms of toxicity (TWiST). HRQOL endpoints were analysed in all randomly assigned patients. The trial is ongoing but closed to new participants. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01844986.
Between Sept 3, 2013, and March 6, 2015, 1084 patients were enrolled. 693 patients were ineligible, leaving 391 eligible patients who were randomly assigned to olaparib (n=260) or placebo (n=131; one placebo patient withdrew before receiving any study treatment), with a median duration of follow-up of 40·7 months (IQR 34·9-42·9) for olaparib and 41·2 months (32·2-41·6) for placebo. There was no clinically meaningful change in TOI score at 24 months within or between the olaparib and placebo groups (adjusted mean change in score from baseline over 24 months was 0·30 points [95% CI -0·72 to 1·32] in the olaparib group vs 3·30 points [1·84 to 4·76] in the placebo group; between-group difference of -3·00, 95% CI -4·78 to -1·22; p=0·0010). Mean quality-adjusted progression-free survival (olaparib 29·75 months [95% CI 28·20-31·63] vs placebo 17·58 [15·05-20·18]; difference 12·17 months [95% CI 9·07-15·11], p<0·0001) and the mean duration of TWiST (olaparib 33·15 months [95% CI 30·82-35·49] vs placebo 20·24 months [17·36-23·11]; difference 12·92 months [95% CI 9·30-16·54]; p<0·0001) were significantly longer with olaparib than with placebo.
The substantial progression-free survival benefit provided by maintenance olaparib in the newly diagnosed setting was achieved with no detrimental effect on patients' HRQOL and was supported by clinically meaningful quality-adjusted progression-free survival and TWiST benefits with maintenance olaparib versus placebo.

88,33862000,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX and preoperative chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (UNICANCER-PRODIGE 23): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.","Treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer with chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy controls local disease, but distant metastases remain common. We aimed to assess whether administering neoadjuvant chemotherapy before preoperative chemoradiotherapy could reduce the risk of distant recurrences.
We did a phase 3, open-label, multicentre, randomised trial at 35 hospitals in France. Eligible patients were adults aged 18-75 years and had newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven, rectal adenocarcinoma staged cT3 or cT4 M0, with a WHO performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group or standard-of-care group, using an independent web-based system by minimisation method stratified by centre, extramural extension of the tumour into perirectal fat according to MRI, tumour location, and stage. Investigators and participants were not masked to treatment allocation. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy group received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m
Between June 5, 2012, and June 26, 2017, 461 patients were randomly assigned to either the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (n=231) or the standard-of-care group (n=230). At a median follow-up of 46·5 months (IQR 35·4-61·6), 3-year disease-free survival rates were 76% (95% CI 69-81) in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 69% (62-74) in the standard-of-care group (stratified hazard ratio 0·69, 95% CI 0·49-0·97; p=0·034). During neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (38 [17%] of 225 patients) and diarrhoea (25 [11%] of 226). During chemoradiotherapy, the most common grade 3-4 adverse event was lymphopenia (59 [28%] of 212 in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group vs 67 [30%] of 226 patients in the standard-of-care group). During adjuvant chemotherapy, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were lymphopenia (18 [11%] of 161 in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group vs 42 [27%] of 155 in the standard-of-care group), neutropenia (nine [6%] of 161 vs 28 [18%] of 155), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (19 [12%] of 162 vs 32 [21%] of 155). Serious adverse events occurred in 63 (27%) of 231 participants in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 50 (22%) of 230 patients in the standard-of-care group (p=0·167), during the whole treatment period. During adjuvant therapy, serious adverse events occurred in 18 (11%) of 163 participants in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 36 (23%) of 158 patients in the standard-of-care group (p=0·0049). Treatment-related deaths occurred in one (<1%) of 226 patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (sudden death) and two (1%) of 227 patients in the standard-of-care group (one sudden death and one myocardial infarction).
Intensification of chemotherapy using FOLFIRINOX before preoperative chemoradiotherapy significantly improved outcomes compared with preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with cT3 or cT4 M0 rectal cancer. The significantly improved disease-free survival in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and the decreased neurotoxicity indicates that the perioperative approach is more efficient and better tolerated than adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, the PRODIGE 23 results might change clinical practice.

92,33861992,Diagnosis and Evaluation of Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis: CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report.,"The purpose of this analysis is to provide evidence-based and consensus-derived guidance for clinicians to improve individual diagnostic decision-making for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) and decrease diagnostic practice variability.
Approved panelists developed key questions regarding the diagnosis of HP using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format. MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for relevant literature, which was supplemented by manual searches. References were screened for inclusion and vetted evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of included studies, to extract data, and to grade the level of evidence supporting each recommendation or statement. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted and voted on using a modified Delphi technique to achieve consensus. A diagnostic algorithm is provided, using supporting data from the recommendations where possible, along with expert consensus to help physicians gauge the probability of HP.
The systematic review of the literature based on 14 PICO questions resulted in 14 key action statements: 12 evidence-based, graded recommendations and 2 ungraded consensus-based statements. All evidence was of very low quality.
Diagnosis of HP should employ a patient-centered approach and include multidisciplinary assessment that incorporates the environmental and occupational exposure history and CT pattern to establish diagnostic confidence before considering bronchoalveolar lavage and/or lung biopsy. Criteria are presented to facilitate diagnosis of HP. Additional research is needed on the performance characteristics and generalizability of exposure assessment tools and traditional and new diagnostic tests in modifying clinical decision-making for HP, particularly among those with a provisional diagnosis.",Cancer,diagnosis evaluation hypersensitivity pneumonitis chest guideline expert panel report,purpose analysis provide evidencebased consensusderived guidance clinician improve individual diagnostic decisionmaking hypersensitivity pneumonitis hp decrease diagnostic practice variability approved panelist developed key question regarding diagnosis hp using pico population intervention comparator outcome format medline via pubmed cochrane library systematically searched relevant literature supplemented manual search reference screened inclusion vetted evaluation tool used ass quality included study extract data grade level evidence supporting recommendation statement quality evidence assessed using grade grading recommendation assessment development evaluation approach graded recommendation ungraded consensusbased statement drafted voted using modified delphi technique achieve consensus diagnostic algorithm provided using supporting data recommendation possible along expert consensus help physician gauge probability hp systematic review literature based pico question resulted key action statement evidencebased graded recommendation ungraded consensusbased statement evidence low quality diagnosis hp employ patientcentered approach include multidisciplinary assessment incorporates environmental occupational exposure history ct pattern establish diagnostic confidence considering bronchoalveolar lavage andor lung biopsy criterion presented facilitate diagnosis hp additional research needed performance characteristic generalizability exposure assessment tool traditional new diagnostic test modifying clinical decisionmaking hp particularly among provisional diagnosis
93,33861991,A pan-cancer transcriptome analysis of exitron splicing identifies novel cancer driver genes and neoepitopes.,"Exitron splicing (EIS) creates a cryptic intron (called an exitron) within a protein-coding exon to increase proteome diversity. EIS is poorly characterized, but emerging evidence suggests a role for EIS in cancer. Through a systematic investigation of EIS across 33 cancers from 9,599 tumor transcriptomes, we discovered that EIS affected 63% of human coding genes and that 95% of those events were tumor specific. Notably, we observed a mutually exclusive pattern between EIS and somatic mutations in their affected genes. Functionally, we discovered that EIS altered known and novel cancer driver genes for causing gain- or loss-of-function, which promotes tumor progression. Importantly, we identified EIS-derived neoepitopes that bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II. Analysis of clinical data from a clear cell renal cell carcinoma cohort revealed an association between EIS-derived neoantigen load and checkpoint inhibitor response. Our findings establish the importance of considering EIS alterations when nominating cancer driver events and neoantigens.",Cancer,pancancer transcriptome analysis exitron splicing identifies novel cancer driver gene neoepitopes,exitron splicing eis creates cryptic intron called exitron within proteincoding exon increase proteome diversity eis poorly characterized emerging evidence suggests role eis cancer systematic investigation eis across cancer tumor transcriptomes discovered eis affected human coding gene event tumor specific notably observed mutually exclusive pattern eis somatic mutation affected gene functionally discovered eis altered known novel cancer driver gene causing gain lossoffunction promotes tumor progression importantly identified eisderived neoepitopes bind major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii analysis clinical data clear cell renal cell carcinoma cohort revealed association eisderived neoantigen load checkpoint inhibitor response finding establish importance considering eis alteration nominating cancer driver event neoantigens

Their concentrations are indicators of oxidative stress in vivo and associated with atherosclerosis. Subclinical hypothyroidism is related with cardiac diseases and oxidative stress, but the exact mechanisms underlying these associations are not clear yet.
To investigate the auto-oxidized oxysterols, 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) and cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (chol-triol), in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, as well as to evaluate the impact of restoring euthyroidism on oxysterol concentrations.
In this prospective observational study, 64 patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroiditis (41 with subclinical hypothyroidism and 23 euthyroidism), and 45 healthy controls were enrolled. Age, gender, and body mass index were matched among patient groups and healthy controls. Anthropometric measurements were obtained and fasting plasma 7-ketocholesterol and cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol concentrations were measured by using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Levothyroxine was then administered to all patients with subclinical-hypothyroidism. After three months, measurements of the oxysterols and serum cholesterols from the patients who have become euthyroid were repeated.
Concentrations of 7-ketocholesterol and cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol were significantly higher in patients with subclinical-hypothyroidism when compared to both euthyroid patients and healthy controls (p<0.001 for both oxysterols). After restoration of euthyroidism, concentrations of 7-ketocholesterol and cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol decreased significantly and reached similar concentrations observed in healthy controls (p<0.001 for both oxysterols).

95,33861984,SIRT2 and SIRT3 expression correlates with redox imbalance and advanced clinical stage in patients with multiple myeloma.,"Sirtuins comprise seven family elements (SIRT1-7) involved in various cell signalling pathways comprising cancer inhibition and tumorigenesis. The present study aims to evaluate SIRT2 and SIRT3 gene expression and potential redox reactions in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) at onset and its correlation with disease status, extent and presence of organ damage secondary to myeloma.
Total RNA was extracted from 17 MM patients and 10 controls to assess gene expression using real-time PCR. The NAD+/NADH ratio as well as the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and hydrogen peroxide (HP) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined using established biochemical assays.
SIRT2 and SIRT3 expression is reduced in MM patients compared to healthy controls. Correlational analysis demonstrated that SIRT2 reduction is associated with advanced clinical stage and with more advanced bone lesions than in the remaining patients. SIRT3 expression is correlated with lytic bone lesions. Biochemical analysis indicated an imbalance of oxidative stress biomarkers with low concentrations of the antioxidant enzyme GPx, low amounts of NAD+ and higher concentrations of pro-oxidant enzyme HP in PBMCs of MM patients compared to controls. Moreover, MM patients with bone lesions had lower concentrations of NAD+ and GPx in PBMCs than patients without signs of bone disease. In addition, MM patients had higher quantities of intracellular HP than controls.
our results demonstrate that SIRT2 and SIRT3 are downregulated in MM and that lower concentrations correlate with an advanced stage of disease and redox imbalance.
